('\"Young Master\", Type 19', 'Beware of Chicken', 6, 'While a lot of stuff wouldn’t look out of place in ancient china, the exchange was not one of those features. Or at least I thought it looked strange. A building where all the merchants gathered, like some kind of ancient mall? I was expecting a marketplace the last time I came here, not… this.\r\n\r\nBut I guess faster travel in the form of Artifacts, and communication in transmission stones could make something like this possible.\r\n\r\nShaking my head, I went about my business. First, was Tan Gong’s Heavenly Furs. Which was a super fucking pretentious name for a dude who dealt in mortal furs. But it was none of my business. There was a small line of people selling things. Some people got shouted out of the line for poor quality, while some completed their transactions quickly.\r\n\r\nThe man sitting behind the booth and wearing a uniform met me with a frown on his face.\r\n\r\n“Ugh. Another dirt farmer. Yes, yes, boy. Make it quick. I’m sure you think your pelts are worthy to be purchased by our Heavenly Furs company but we have exacting standards–my word!”\r\n\r\nI had, naturally, ignored his speechifying, and bought out the pelts. His eyes bugged out, and he swallowed.\r\n\r\nHey, xianxia tropes are in fine form today. Now hes apologising for being hasty and wringing his hands, and calling me “Good Sir”. I guess this is the part where I should start face slapping him, but I really don’t care.\r\n\r\nWhatever dude, you’re practically drooling over my stuff, you want to buy it or not?\r\n\r\nOf course, I was actually keeping my mouth shut with a small smile on my face, and nodding along appropriately. There was nothing to be gained from insulting some rando dude manning a counter–\r\n\r\nAnd now hes bought his manager out. Who is also calling me Good Sir. And making noises of wanting me to have a contract to supply them.\r\n\r\nI declined as politely as I could, and just sold them the pelts.\r\n\r\n“If you ever have any other furs to sell, please think kindly of our Heavenly Furs company!” The men both said and bowed.\r\n\r\nOf course I’m going to “think kindly” of you, you’re the only gig in town.\r\n\r\nThe man who bought my planks of wood was considerably more polite. An Ren was a good bloke.\r\n\r\nI then went to shop for my own supplies. More sesame oil, sesame seeds, I found a guy with some wheat, which was a major boon. Ah, bread, how I’ve missed you. Wouldn’t be able to plant it now, because fall was going to start soon, but Other than that, a bunch more veggie seeds, some more barrels, and a few more chickens, and a lovely set of cast iron pans.\r\n\r\nI briefly debated getting a pig or a cow, but decided against it for now. Gotta establish the farm a bit better I think.\r\n\r\nI’d probably be meeting up with Meimei soon, so we could go through the last of the herb guides. Today was a good day.\r\n\r\nMy back itched a little bit, as I stepped into the town again. I scratched it absentmindedly.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nMeiling had been having a good day.\r\n\r\nEmphasis on “Had”.\r\n\r\nIt had started out well enough. Jin had some business to take care of, so she had invited Meihua out into the town. They had walked together, arm and arm, and had enjoyed the city together. Meihua had even bought her a lovely new hairpin, and now, they were sitting down to have tea together.\r\n\r\nBut her sister in all but blood uttered foul betrayal.\r\n\r\n“So, when is Jin marrying you?” She asked conversationally, just as Meiling had taken a sip from her tea.\r\n\r\nShe choked as it went down the way, and started coughing.\r\n\r\n“Wha-Uh? Not- Maybe-Nev– Meihua!” She gasped, and her friend laughed merrily, the sound like tinkling chimes.\r\n\r\nShe glared at her friend. “Not you too,” she whined, “I’m getting enough of that from father! We haven’t done anything either, so wipe that knowing look off your face, you vile woman!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you snuck out in the night with him~”\r\n\r\n“Meihua, please.” She begged, her face red.\r\n\r\n“Allright, I’ll stop. All attack, no defense with you. You do like him though, don’t you?”\r\n\r\nShort, brown hair. Vibrant green eyes. That stupid grin.\r\n\r\nHer lips quirked up into an almost smile.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear,” Meihua said, looking at her fondly, “You are smitten, Meimei. Almost as bad as I am for my darling~”\r\n\r\n“Shaddup.” she grumbled, and drained the rest of her tea. Meihua giggled again, but obligingly finished up as well, and needled her no further.\r\n\r\n“Come on, I can’t deal with you anymore,” Meiling said acidly, but Meihua just smiled knowingly, “Lets get you to your darling–”\r\n\r\nThere was an acrid tang on the wind, that was sliding under the smell of earth that she had gotten used to. Blood and Oil. An insidious, slimy thing, full of ill intent.\r\n\r\nQi.\r\n\r\nHer head whipped sound, and she saw the man. Dressed in fine clothes, with two men standing on either side of him. His head started turning in her direction, and she looked away.\r\n\r\n“Meihua. This way.” Meihua noticed her discomfort, and obliged her. They exited the small outdoor seating area swiftly, Meiling practically dragging her friend behind her through an alley on the way to the palace.\r\n\r\n“Meimei, whats going–”\r\n\r\n“Qi. Cultivator. I know you think my nose is off on Jin, but please, trust me on this.”\r\n\r\nMeihua sighed. “All right. But I think you’ve read too many stories. Would someone dare do something like that?”\r\n\r\nMeiling grimaced. And kept walking to the palace.\r\n\r\n“I hope we never find out.”\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\nMeimei was looking off when we met up, all tense angry. I asked her what was wrong, but got a snapped “nothing” and decided to leave it.\r\n\r\nThe next few hours passed in silence, but we didn’t find anything on my root. I wasn’t bothered, and the hours of reading had bled some of the tension out of Meimei’s shoulders.\r\n\r\n“….it wasn’t nothing.”\r\n\r\nI gestured for her to continue.\r\n\r\n“I can smell qi.”\r\n\r\nHuh, so thats how she followed me.\r\n\r\n“…and theres a cultivator in Verdant hill. He smells like oil and blood. He had nasty eyes too.”\r\n\r\nWell, thats not good.\r\n\r\n“I’m probably just being paranoid… but I’m worried about Meihua. Shes in the palace right now, so there should be no problems.. But…”\r\n\r\nWhat? Sure, Meihua was kind of pretty, but some douche just going full young master on her?\r\n\r\nMeimei looked stressed and worried.\r\n\r\n“C’mon” I said, after we put the scrolls back away. “Lets go pick up Meihua and …Tingfeng? We’ll have dinner together.”\r\n\r\n“….Fine.” she muttered, still looking stressed. That wouldn’t do.\r\n\r\n“My Lady Hong Meiling, would you do me the honour of dining with me tonight?”\r\n\r\nHer lips quirked up this time, and she gave me a halfhearted glare.\r\n\r\n“Of course. Jin Rou, I would be honoured to dine with you.” Ouch, I could feel the sarcasm.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t take long to reach the palace. Meihua seemed delighted to see us, and immediately clasped arms with Meimei, while I nodded at Tingfeng.\r\n\r\nWe set off for dinner.\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\n“And then she called me, what was it again? A “wretched, pig-headed shitmonkey?” It was great!”\r\n\r\nI slung my arm around Meimei’s shoulders and pulled her close while Tingfeng howled with laughter. Meimei rammed her elbow ineffectually into my side, so red I thought she might have a stroke.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I remember when she called me a worthless slug sniffing around a lotus flower! She was right, back then, and those words gave me the strength to earn my position, if only to prove her harsh words wrong.”\r\n\r\nTingfeng grinned at Meimei, walking with Meihua arm in arm back to the inn. Meimei had given up trying to escape, and was now just glaring half-heartedly at me.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly froze, and paled. My back itched.\r\n\r\nThree men suddenly appeared in front of us, looking for trouble.\r\n\r\n…were we getting mugged?\r\n\r\nThe leader, in silks, smiled. “I am Zang Li of the Shrouded Mountain sect. You girl, be honoured. I shall allow you to warm my bed tonight.”\r\n\r\nI frowned. Something didn’t feel right.\r\n\r\n“Do his lackeys have qi?” I whispered to Meimei. She sniffed, and nodded. I could feel how tense she was where my hand was on her arm.\r\n\r\n“Not much, compared to you.” she bit back tersely.\r\n\r\nWell, that settled it then. If they had less than me, they were definitely not part of the Shrouded Mountain.\r\n\r\nI took my arm off Meimei.\r\n\r\n“No, she won’t be doing that.” I said simply.\r\n\r\n“You dare oppose the Shrouded Mountain sect?” The cultivator sneered.\r\n\r\nI scoffed. “You aren’t Shrouded Mountain. And I doubt they’ll be happy about you taking their name, buddy.”\r\n\r\nThe cultivator glared, and he snapped his fingers. His buddies drew swords and jumped at me, but hell, even I was more than a match for them. They were certainly slower than that big wolf I brained for Meiling. Poor thing had the mange or something, and it was still better than these guys..\r\n\r\nI gave both of them a good smack, and then started towards fuckboy playing at being a young master. Qi exploded around him.\r\n\r\nI paused, a bit worried at his development.\r\n\r\n“You bastard, you’re courting death–!” He roared.” Behold the technique that slew a cultivator in the profound realm! My ultimate spear!”\r\n\r\n“Heaven Piercing Lance!”\r\n\r\nOh shit he was fast— I didn’t have time to block, and gathered my qi in defense for the first time in months.\r\n\r\nHe hit me in the chest–\r\n\r\nAnd his fingers bent backwards. Like the wrong way backwards.\r\n\r\nHe fell back and started screaming.\r\n\r\nThe fuck?\r\n\r\n….how much of a shitter can you be?!\r\n\r\nI gave him a good smack for being an idiot, then gathered them all up, and took them to jail. Tingfeng came with me.\r\n\r\nI hope I can convince the captain of the guard to just say I was a wandering cultivator. I don’t want any douche nozzles to come try and find me in case he had friends.\r\n\r\n//////\r\n\r\nMeiling stared around the street. Grass and flowers had grown up from around every stone. The trees, preparing for the fall, had all grown blossoms. The wooden buildings closest to the impact point had started growing branches, with tiny leaves poking off them.\r\n\r\n“….Told you my nose hadn’t gone off.” Meiling said, feeling a bit faint.\r\n'),
('A Call to Adventure', 'Cinnamon Bun', 1, '\r\n\r\nI was always the sort of girl that looked for the call to adventure, be it in real life or between the pages of a book. So when my time came, I jumped on it.\r\n\r\nIt all began one fine morning in math class. I was leaning forwards on my desk, elbows down and eyes on the board where our teacher was explaining something about geometric series. It wasn’t my favourite teacher and it was certainly not my favourite subject, but I wanted to keep my grades up all the same. I only had a few months to go before high school was over, and then the whole world was going to open up.\r\n\r\nA low sound rang out. Sort of like a cowbell being dropped from the top of a skyscraper into a fifty-five gallon drum.\r\n\r\nI jumped in my seat and looked around, but all I found were a few students and friends looking at me curiously. I smiled sheepishly and got some grins in return.\r\n\r\nI was about to ask if they had heard the bong noise when it appeared before me. A box, thin and nearly translucent, held in the air by nothing at all and with a simple request on it.\r\n\r\nBong! A great evil has set its root in the world. You are called upon to save it! Do you accept this quest?\r\n\r\nThere were two boxes below that, one labelled ‘I accept’ the other ‘I refuse.’ I tilted my head to the side, the box following the motion, then whipped my head to the other side of the desk only for it to glide back to the centre of my vision.\r\n\r\nI held back a smile. It couldn’t be real.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” I whispered to the girl next to me. “Do you see that?”\r\n\r\nShe followed the direction my finger was pointing and stared at the boy sitting one row ahead. “His hair?” she asked.\r\n\r\nSo, she couldn’t see the floaty prompt box. I waved off her questioning look and refocused on the box. The box that offered me a quest. The box that had appeared with a sound no one else could hear. The box that I suppose no one could see. My grin was so wide my cheeks were hurting.\r\n\r\nI considered what my parents would say, but they were both struck with wanderlust and were the ones responsible for my desire to see the world. They would have been tapping the ‘I accept’ box a million times a second by now.\r\n\r\nGrin firmly in place, I reached out and pressed the ‘I accept’ button.\r\n\r\nDing! The world thanks you for your sacrifice!\r\n\r\nI promptly fell onto my butt.\r\n\r\nThe world had changed in less time than it took to blink. I wasn’t in a sterile classroom anymore with a window overlooking a snowy courtyard or surrounded by about twenty other bored students. No desks, no chairs, no low rumble of distant cars and air exchange systems. Instead, there was birdsong and the croaking of frogs and the gentle murmur of wind through trees.\r\n\r\nI hopped to my feet and looked around. I was in a room still. Most of a room. An ex-room. The floor was paved with large flat stones slotted into each other, and the walls were made of a slightly different kind of stone with thick wooden beams running up to the ceiling above.\r\n\r\nTables that had rotted away were left lying around next to crushed chairs and piles of mulch that might have been leaves once. The entire room stank of mold and rot. It reminded me of camping out in the woods when I was a little younger.\r\n\r\nMost of one wall was entirely missing.\r\n\r\n“Whoa,” I said as I moved as close to the edge as I dared.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately obvious that I was in a tower of some sort, one that rose a level or two above the treeline of the forest beyond. Trees stretched out as far as the eye could see, a sea of swaying green treetops that rose and fell with the dip and rises of the landscape. In the distance was a grey blur that might have been a mountain range that swept into the horizon.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t see any lakes or rivers, but could hear the nearby gurgle of water splashing against stones. Maybe the tower’s other side was against the ocean or a river or something. I couldn’t tell, and in that moment it didn’t matter.\r\n\r\nThe giddiness rose up in my tummy like an overflowing well, and it burst out as a happy giggle.\r\n\r\n“Yes! Yes! Yes!” I shouted to the heavens as I started jumping around the room, arms waving in the air with every cheer. “I made it! I get adventures and dragons and princesses!”\r\n\r\nI ran in little circles while giggling and might have boogied down a little, shaking my hips as happy energy coursed through my veins.\r\n\r\n“Woo! This is going to be awesome!” My scream sent birds flying into the air all in a flutter.\r\n\r\nA bell sounded, light and tinkling, like crystal chimes being struck together.\r\n\r\nDing! For Completing a Special Action while Devoid of Classes, you have unlocked a new Class!\r\n\r\nMy breathing hitched, but if anything the core of excitement in my gut only grew bigger. “A class,” I whispered.\r\n\r\nDing! You are now a Cinnamon Bun!\r\nHealth + 5\r\nStamina +10\r\nMana +5\r\nResilience +10\r\nFlexibility +10\r\nMagic +5\r\n\r\n“Really?” I asked the prompt, but its only response was to fade away.\r\n\r\nThe tropes and stereotypes of a game weren’t new to me, of course, but I had never heard of a class called Cinnamon Bun. I had eaten some of those before, in fact, and they certainly didn’t taste like something someone could be. But maybe this world was different. I hoped that this world was different.\r\n\r\nWith dragons and elves and monsters of all sorts! I would be able to grow strong and tough and I’d meet a dragon and ride it into battle and maybe have tea with some dwarves and I was getting ahead of myself...\r\n\r\nThere was usually some menu or status page in the books that I’d read. And so thinking, my mind was flooded with information. Not very much, but some facts and figures and a sort of... memory of a screen. “Whoa.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Name 	Broccoli Bunch 	 \r\n  	Race 	Human 	 \r\n  	First Class 	Cinnamon Bun 	 \r\n  	First Class Level 	0 	 \r\n  	Age 	16 	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Health 	105\r\n	 \r\n  	Stamina    110\r\n	 \r\n  	Mana       105\r\n	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Resilience   15\r\n	 \r\n  	Flexibility 15\r\n	 \r\n  	Magic       10\r\n	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Skills 	Rank N/A 	  	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n\r\n\r\n“So cool!” This, of course, prompted more happy dancing. I had a class and an empty skills list and a bunch of numbers that meant more than anything I had worked on in maths class. Also, Magic.\r\n\r\nI didn’t know what some of them meant, but it didn’t matter! I had them and they were mine! A bit of a push and the box with my status and all appeared before my very eyes. I hugged it.\r\n\r\nOr, well, I tried to hug it. The box kept juking out of hug reach, even when I started laughing and skipping after it. It was a good box and good boxes deserved all the hugs. Then, with a soap-bubble like pop, the box disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Okay, okay, Broc, calm yourself,” I said between still escaping giggles. A few deep breaths helped to chill me out. I wanted to sit down, to inspect my super cool new stats and maybe to skip some more because I felt brilliant.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the tower’s floor was a mess. Tables ruined, chairs, all save for one rickety thing in the corner, all busted up. There was a shovel with a flat head leaning against one wall though, and an ancient broom with bristles made from some plant or another.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to have a rest, this wasn’t the place for it, not unless I cleaned it up a little.\r\n\r\nThe only exit to the room was behind a stack of fallen stones, each one looking as if they weighed as much as I did.\r\n\r\nI pulled up the only seat that looked able to take my weight, then wiped its surface clean.\r\n\r\nDing! For doing a Special Action in line with your Class, you have unlocked the skill: Cleaning!\r\n\r\nI laughed. A skill! A silly, rather boring skill, but maybe one that would help. It would help even more if I grinded a little, and I did like cleaning.\r\n\r\nNodding to myself, I picked up the broom and shovel and got to work. First making sure that the ground below the opening in the wall was clear of anyone or anything, then I started shovelling up the dead leaves and pushing them out.\r\n\r\nA bit of grunting and some sweating had the broken tables busted up even more and stacked up neatly off to one side. The moldier bits I tossed out. Maybe I would have to build a fire later. Not that I had a lighter or matches, but I could make do.\r\n\r\nThen came the sweeping. I swiped at the cobwebs in the corners, swept the floor clean and even dusted off the one usable chair I found.\r\n\r\nEvery so often I felt a whisper of a ‘ding’ in the back of my mind, like a distant noise that was just barely audible. A quick bit of focusing revealed that it was my Cleaning skill rising up, and quickly at that.\r\n\r\nProbably because of its low level, I decided.\r\n\r\nSoon enough the room was as clean as it would be. The mold brushed off the walls with more enthusiasm than skill, the floors swept, the broken furniture sorted and a small table and chair arranged to one side where I could sit down and relax.\r\n\r\nI sighed as I flopped onto my seat, the old wood creaking under my weight but not breaking. “Classes!” I decided. That’s where I would start.\r\n\r\nFirst Class: Cinnamon Bun\r\nLevel 0\r\nYou are the Cinnamon Bun. Too good for this world. Too pure. You are the perfect support and friend to all. Nature itself smiles upon you.\r\nCleanse this world of its impurities in the name of love and justice!\r\n\r\nI snorted. That wasn’t the most helpful description I’d ever seen. Too pure? Well, that... okay, so maybe I was a little naive, sometimes, all of my friends said so, and everyone was my friend. But the Class description didn’t have to be so smug about it. Also, First Class, which meant that I could maybe unlock a second at some point. Dragon Rider class, here I come!\r\n\r\nThe Cleaning skill sort of made sense if it was tied to some sort of class ability to cleanse things.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was a class that was good against the undead? I certainly hoped so! Seeing a walking skeleton would be creepy. Unless it was a nice gentlemanly skeleton, in which case that was alright.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t okay to mock or judge others because of their appearance after all.\r\n\r\nHumming to myself, I focused on my Cleaning Skill instead.\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank F - 90%\r\nThe ability to clean. As this skill rises in level your ability to Clean will improve!\r\n\r\n“Well, okay.” That was utterly underwhelming. Still, maybe as I got better at it I would be able to keep myself and the world around me clean too! It was worth it!\r\n\r\nI stretched in my new seat then hopped off. It wasn’t time for sitting back and relaxing. It was time to do stuff! First I had a bunch of things to test out!\r\n\r\nTrying to figure out if I had an inventory of some sort was fruitless. No amount of shouting ‘inventory!’ amounted to anything. Then I looked for a handy help menu, but that was absent too. But, after much searching and some head scratching, I found something incredible.\r\n\r\nYou have one (1) Active Quest:\r\nThe Hole Down Under\r\nAn evil root has plunged into the world. Find it. Remove it.\r\n\r\nThat was it. No waypoints, no hints. Not even a handy-dandy list of rewards. I huffed at the quest box and that was apparently its hint that it wasn’t needed anymore. What even was an evil root?\r\n\r\nWell, that didn’t matter. Maybe it was the sort of quest that would take a long, long time to accomplish. I didn’t have that luxury. The sum total of my belongings amounted to a pretty blouse I had bought on sale a week ago, a sturdy pair of shoes I liked, a thick cotton skirt that reached to just below the knees and some warm stockings. And of course my underthings.\r\n\r\nNot even a jacket.\r\n\r\nFortunately it was warm wherever I was. So no need for too much warm clothing. Though a blanket would have been nice. Or a towel.\r\n\r\nI had failed hitchhiking one-oh-one already.\r\n\r\nShrugging to myself, I moved to the edge of the hole in the wall and looked down. Two stories from my little nook to the ground, at least judging by the number of windows. The floors looked rather tall. Or maybe that was my newly discovered fear of falling to my death that was talking.\r\n\r\nA look over to the blocked doorway confirmed that there was no way I was moving the stones there.\r\n\r\nNo ropes, no safety equipment, no easy way down.\r\n\r\nAt least the rocky walls of the tower were rough and had plenty of handholds. It might be possible, easy even, to climb down.\r\n\r\nFirming up my resolve, I prepared myself to climb over the edge. My first step into a wild new world!\r\n'),
('A Look into the Past', 'Cinnamon Bun', 9, '\r\n\r\nI stayed up late to read. The herbology book was still at the bottom of my backpack, forgotten as I read through ancient reports illuminated by the flickering light of a candle.\r\n\r\nReport, Seventh of Harvest\r\nApprehended drunk bard at Well Inn Good, began a brawl with local musicians over ‘the quality of the music.’ Minor property damage evaluated at two sil, three cop. Confined in cell overnight until sober.\r\n-Overseer Hardy\r\n\r\nA bard. Was it Bonesy a long time ago?\r\n\r\nReport, Eight of Harvest\r\nMana fluctuations detected by local mages including alchemist. No sighting of the adventuring party sent out to the Dunwich dungeon.\r\n-Overseer Hardy\r\n\r\nA dungeon? Those were a thing here?\r\n\r\nReport two, Eight of Harvest\r\nLarge mana shifts. Felt them myself. Worried someone might have damaged the dungeon core. Guard rotation C spotted someone in the forests in green. Imperials? This far out? It could explain the shifts in local mana. Doubled the guards just in case. Sent a scout to the Dunwich Dungeon.\r\n-Overseer Hardy\r\n\r\nThings were getting interesting, very interesting. A dungeon sounded like a neat place to visit, and there was a lot of talk here about mana as if it was a thing that was just... in the air. I wondered if the mana here was thick or thin and if I would be able to tell the difference.\r\n\r\nReport, Ninth of Harvest\r\nDunwich dungeon was destroyed. The shifts in mana are the ley lines snapping apart. Spoke to the mayor. She doesn’t want to evacuate but we have no choice, not with Imperials so close and the mana turning like this. No news of the adventuring team sent out. Still have their bard in a cell. Will release him later.\r\nMore imperial sightings. Hopefully they’ll let a group of civilians pass unharmed.\r\n-Overseer Hardy\r\n\r\nAnd that was it. No more reports, just a few blank pages. So there were ley lines for magic. And Bonesy the Bard had been part of an adventuring group. That was kind of neat! Good on him. Not so good was how he had caused trouble at the Inn. He was just as poorly behaved in life as he was in death.\r\n\r\nDing! For repeating a Special Action a sufficient number of times you have unlocked the skill: Archaeology!\r\n\r\nI smiled and blew out the candle, then shifted until sleep took me at long last.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI woke up feeling refreshed. Not at my best, and my tummy still rumbled for food that wasn’t honey, but the pall of depression was lifted and I felt my face twisting back into my usual smile. Then I unleashed a blast of cleaning magic at myself and shivered as mana coursed over my body and clothes. It was like taking a shower but better.\r\n\r\nStanding up, I stretched, ran through an abridged version of my morning routine (I’d give all of my silver for a toothbrush and paste) then stepped outside after making sure the coast was clear of ghosts.\r\n\r\nToday was the day I would take on the wraith. But first, I had a church to explore and a sickly sweet breakfast to lick.\r\n\r\nI strolled across the ghost town, spoon in mouth and attention swivelling around to take in everything. Things had changed in the two short days I had been here. There had been grass when I first came out, but it was brown and feeble and kind of sad. Now bushes were sprouting up everywhere and the grass was thick and lush and vibrant. The entire world seemed more alive, somehow.\r\n\r\nWas it because there were fewer ghosts?\r\n\r\nI couldn’t believe that level one monsters were that strong. But then again, the ghosts couldn’t be hurt through normal means. Maybe the animals and such were careful and cautious around them--proving once more than the average animal was smarter than little old me.\r\n\r\nThe church was a stately building, even with fresh vines climbing up its sides and huge holes poked through its stained glass windows. It looked like the kind of place that local weddings would be held in, and where a nice old priest would try to help people with their problems and all the old ladies would gather to trade the juiciest gossip.\r\n\r\nThere was a sense of lost serenity around the building, a sensation that took me a long time to name and would take longer to get used to. It would have felt wrong to scream and shout or fight.\r\n\r\nI pushed open the front door and slid into the main hall. It was a single large room with rows of wooden benches all facing a trio of stone altars. Dust swirled in the air and the light, most of it pouring through the mosaic windows, coloured the entire room in a spectrum of soft blues and greens and reds.\r\n\r\n“Hello?” I asked as I moved in. Only silence greeted me. I moved through the room, careful to be as quiet and respectful as I could until I was at the altars. They were all different. Did they practice one faith with many gods here, or were there many religions housed in one church?\r\n\r\nThe first altar had a small stone chalice built into it, with stone grapes and fruit around its base. The second had a carving of an arm holding an axe engraved atop it and the third had a statue of an archway reaching from one side to the other.\r\n\r\nStrange, disparate symbols with meanings I could only guess at. Most buried under a layer of dust. Three quick flashes of magic cleared the altars, leaving them as the only untouched things in the entire room. A strange dichotomy, maybe.\r\n\r\nI bowed to the three altars and moved on. There was nothing for me here.\r\n\r\nAccording to my map I still had five houses to explore, but I doubted I would find anything incredible there. No, my goal at that moment was to face the wraith and inspect the hole. I could return to exploring at any time after that.\r\n\r\nThe monster was hovering over the opened pit, twisting and turning and writhing in the air as if it was wracked with pain. Pain that it almost seemed to enjoy. Now that I was closer I could hear its delighted howls, the almost ecstatic moans that it made as jolts of... something coursed through it.\r\n\r\nWhatever the wraith was feeding on came from the hole. Evil mana, maybe? I could only guess.\r\n\r\nMy backpack was left on the doorstep of a nearby home. I took a moment to go over my plan, as simple as it was. I was going to go out and attack the wraith, first with the showerhead-flail I had, then by throwing my magic wand through it. Then, if it was sufficiently distracted, I would use my cleaning spell on it.\r\n\r\nIf things went well that would be enough to clear it out.\r\n\r\nThe very first step though, of course, was to talk to it.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was a nice evil wraith? “Insight.”\r\n\r\nAn evil wraith, level 2.\r\n\r\nMaybe not. But I wouldn’t hit someone in the back without at least trying to talk first. Anything else would just be wrong.\r\n\r\nI sat back and ate another spoonful of honey as I looked over my many skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Name 	Broccoli Bunch 	 \r\n  	Race 	Human 	 \r\n  	First Class 	Cinnamon Bun 	 \r\n  	First Class Level 	1 	 \r\n  	Age 	16 	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Health 	\r\n105​\r\n	 \r\n  	Stamina 	\r\n115​\r\n	 \r\n  	Mana 	\r\n105​\r\n	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Resilience 	\r\n15​\r\n	 \r\n  	Flexibility 	\r\n20​\r\n	 \r\n  	Magic 	\r\n10​\r\n	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Skills 	Rank 	 \r\n  	Cinnamon Bun Skills 	  	 \r\n  	Cleaning 	C - 14% 	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	General Skills 	  	 \r\n  	Insight 	E - 97% 	 \r\n  	Makeshift Weapon Proficiency 	F - 42% 	 \r\n  	Archeology 	F - 15% 	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was quite the warrior it seemed. “Soon,” I whispered in the deepest darkest voice I could manage. It came out squeaky, but it was the thought that counted! “Everyone across all the realms will learn to respect the might of Broccoli the great Cinnamon Bun!”\r\n\r\nI might have been able to get Insight up another level, but that didn’t feel necessary, or even helpful in a fight. Makeshift weapons would have been a good skill to level, but I wasn’t sure how to do that except to fight some more, and there wasn’t anything left to fight that I had seen so far.\r\n\r\nWell, ghosts didn’t generally move very fast. I would try against this one and see how things worked out. Worse case, I was an excellent runner.\r\n\r\nI stepped out into the morning sunlight, makeshift flail hanging by my side, mana topped off at max and a determined frown on my face. I walked over to the evil well of evilness until I was only a few dozen paces away. “Hello!” I called out.\r\n\r\nThe wraith paused in its weird wriggling and turned.\r\n\r\nMy blood ran cold.\r\n\r\nThe wraith screamed.\r\n\r\nYou have heard the screech of a fearsome creature! Your soul is shaken.\r\n\r\nMy breathing hitched and I had a sudden urge to run to the nearest bathroom as the monster tore through the sky towards me. Its hands stretched and shifted, turning into long, scythe-like claws.\r\n\r\nI snapped out of it just in time to hop backwards and narrowly avoid the first swing. The wraith screamed again, but this time I was a little more ready for it and managed not to pee my skirts. Instead I flung my showerhead flail at the monster and almost fainted when it bounced off its face.\r\n\r\nThe wraith flinched back, face leaking the same plumes of dust the ghosts had, though in far smaller quantities.\r\n\r\nIt spun around and charged at me again.\r\n\r\nI rolled out of its path, then tossed the magic wand that merely booped its chest and left only the tiniest of wounds.\r\n\r\nNot enough, not nearly enough.\r\n\r\nI started spinning the flail around and around until it hummed through the air. The wraith came at me again, its one track mind not terribly suited to thinking, it seemed. My flail crashed into its hand, a spark of magic burst from the impact, the wraith screeched, though now in pain rather than anger.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” I said as I lunged closer to it and pressed a hand against its chest. “Clean!”\r\n\r\nMy mana dropped, then dropped faster as I poured more and more into the attempt to cleanse the monster. A patch formed around my hand, slowly growing and spreading across its body. First a few centimeters, then a few more in an expanding circle.\r\n\r\nMy mana hit zero.\r\n\r\nThe world shifted, the corners of my vision going blurry as I stumbled back and fell onto my bum.\r\n\r\nThe wraith was twisting and screeching, its one remaining clawed arm trying to push back all of its dusty stuff into the massive tear in its chest. It gave up after a moment and started to move towards the hole. Slower now, much slower than its earlier charge.\r\n\r\nThis was my chance, my opportunity to run back and regroup, to figure out a new strategy and maybe let my mana return to full.\r\n\r\nI stumbled to my feet and ran after the wraith, for a certain definition of ‘ran.’ My stumbling gait didn’t stop me from spinning my flail again, and when the ghostly monster started to suck at the evil mana it left itself wide open.\r\n\r\nThe flail rammed into and through its body, cutting off its lower half to let it float down and turn to so much dust.\r\n\r\nIt spun around, the back of its claws raking across my face and chest and sending me flying a few feet. “Ouch,” I said as I landed on my back. I wanted to stay there for a moment, but huge claws spearing down at me were enough encouragement that I rolled to the side. Just in time, too, as the talons dug into the ground where I had been.\r\n\r\nAnother smack of the flail, weaker this time and from an awkward angle, was enough to push its hands away. My mana was back to one. One mana.\r\n\r\nI slapped my hand on its screeching face and fired off my cleaning spell. It was little more than a short lived burst, but that was enough to make it race backwards and give me some room. I scrambled back, then got to my feet.\r\n\r\n“You are a big, fat meaniehead!” I taunted the monster.\r\n\r\nIt kind of just stared at me angrily. I was going to need to learn the taunt skill one of these days, if that was even a thing.\r\n\r\nAnother spin of my flail ended with the shower head smacking the now weakened wraith again, and again, and again.\r\n\r\nThe fight didn’t end in a glorious moment of triumph, but in a constant beatdown, where I delivered blow after blow to an enemy that was less and less capable of fighting back until, finally...\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have laid ‘The Wraith of Threewells by Darkwood’ Level 2! To rest! Bonus Exp was granted for savaging a monster above your level!\r\n\r\n'),
('An Insightful Afternoon', 'Cinnamon Bun', 6, 'Cleaning\r\nRank D - 44%\r\n\r\nI grinned at the results, wiped my forehead dry of sweat and stretched until my back pop-popped in a most satisfactory way. The sun was starting to dip already. It was crazy how much fun you could have just exploring.\r\n\r\nSo far, I had covered two of the houses next to the Inn, both of them much bigger than the homes on the Inn’s other side. They had enough bedrooms and space for big families, and the quality of the furniture was much better. I even managed to find better brooms and a mop that looked almost brand new and that seemed to stay fresh no matter how much I used it.\r\n\r\nA magic mop! Or one that was just really well made.\r\n\r\nI had three more homes to work on in this corner of the town--the section that I suspected was reserved for the richer inhabitants--then I would move all the way to the other end in the poorer section where I could see the peaked roof of a church.\r\n\r\nNodding to myself, I stepped out of the last house, Bonesy in my wash bucket and my mop and broom slung over my shoulder.\r\n\r\nI should have been paying more attention.\r\n\r\nA white hand clawed out towards my face and I squeaked as I bent over backwards to avoid the swipe aimed right at me.\r\n\r\nI fell on my bum, then rolled to the side as a claw raked through the ground where I had fallen. My hand shot out and I grabbed Bonesy, swinging the head around to slice through the next swipe aiming for my face.\r\n\r\nIt worked, making the ghostly hand vanish for a moment before it reformed. It was a big enough window of time that I was able to roll again, then climb onto my feet. My skirt and blouse was soggy where they had rolled in the grass and my hair had gone wild, but that was secondary to the ghost that turned and tried to claw at me again.\r\n\r\n“Not this time, buster,” I said as I swiped Bonesy through one arm, then the other, then with a yell that was totally not a squeak, I swished the skeletal head through the ghost from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nI panted as the ghost faded away to nothing, leaving only a glowing dust behind that soon sparkled away into darkness. “Oh my goshness,” I said as I tried to calm my beating heart. I looked this way and that, taking in the homes all around me and inspecting everything.\r\n\r\nThat had been close. Way too close. And so easy to avoid too. All I had to do was stick my head out of the door and look around and I would have been fine. This wasn’t home--I had to remind myself--where things weren’t out to kill you all day every day.\r\n\r\nMy grip around bonesy tightened and I shivered.\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have made ‘Sentinel Ghost of Threewells by Darkwood’ Level 1 come to a sticky end!\r\n\r\nI stared at the prompt. “Was that a stick pun?” I asked.\r\n\r\nClearly the menu systems in this world were all quite evil. It was something to take my mind off my latest near-death experience... and now I was the one making puns. I groaned and looked up to the sky, taking in the huge blue expanse with the occasional distant birds and the strange balloon in the dista--\r\n\r\nI blinked and focused on what looked like a tiny--or very, very distant--oblong balloon. It was brown-ish grey, with a large red mark on its side and a faint trail of smoke behind it. Not something organic, not with the way it hung motionless in the sky.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” I wondered.\r\n\r\nDing! For repeating a Special Action a sufficient number of times you have unlocked the general skill: Insight!\r\n\r\n“Holy moly!” I looked around. I hadn’t forgotten the whole ghost almost-eating-my-face thing, but this was certainly a nice distraction. “Insight!” I said as I held up Bonesy\r\n\r\nA Skeleton (Level ?) head attached to a stick.\r\n\r\nI laughed, then pressed a hand over my mouth to keep the sound low. Looking up, I stared at the tiny distant shape and thought ‘insight’ as hard as I could.\r\n\r\nAn airship.\r\n\r\n“A flip fluffering airship?” I gasped.\r\n\r\nThere were magical airships around! The world had just gotten a million times cooler. But those were things I’d never get to see if I stayed in this ghost-town...\r\n\r\n“Oh no, the puns are catching up.”\r\n\r\nI shook my head, picked up all of my gear, and moved on to the next house. This one’s front door was locked, but the window was completely smashed in. It was pretty easy to climb in then unlock the door from the inside.\r\n\r\nThere were some bits of furniture left in this house, more so than in others. I made the rounds, checking the kitchen for anything good, then the pantry and the single bedroom and bathroom on the first floor. Nothing. I did find a strange room on the second floor, with large training dummies that were sad and squashed looking where the straw stuffing that had once filled them was rotten away and a rack with some rusty short swords on it. They were probably cheap even before time took its toll. Still, I replaced my fire poker and counted myself lucky.\r\n\r\nIn the next room over, this one an office with a broken window that had let the elements slip in, I found a small dent atop a desk where the dust was sitting strangely. A bit of poking revealed a hidden compartment, but it only held a silvery key and a bit of ribbon that had rotted away. I tucked it in my sack and kept searching, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nOnce I was done with the top floor I began grinding.\r\n\r\n“Insight.”\r\n\r\nA training dummy.\r\n\r\n“Insight!”\r\n\r\nA sword.\r\n\r\n“Insight?”\r\n\r\nA practice pole.\r\n\r\nSo, Insight wasn’t that useful, at least not at this level. That just meant I now had two skills I could grind! Insight seemed to be increasing by a percentage point with every item I used it on, which was simple enough. But I didn\'t want to leave my cleaning fall behind.\r\n\r\nAn hour or so later I carefully, with much snooping around and down and up, moved out of the house and called it done.\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank D - 68%\r\n\r\nInsight\r\nRank F - 89%\r\n\r\nGrinning, I moved onto the next home, then the next. Halfway through the first home a big ‘ding’ resounded in the back of my head and I jumped for joy and spun around with my broom.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Through repeated actions your Insight skill has improved and is now eligible for rank up!\r\nRank E is a free rank!\r\n\r\n“Woo!” I cheered as I bounced on the spot, only stopping when my broom handle banged on the ceiling and sent a wave of dust clattering down onto my head. I coughed and choked and sputtered and basically lost a lot of the good cheer I’d just garnered.\r\n\r\nI accepted the rank up and checked out my crazy new skill.\r\n\r\nInsight\r\nRank E - 00%\r\nThe Ability to know something. The knowledge you gain is increased.\r\n\r\n“Wow!” I said before focusing on Bonesy who was sitting in a corner to watch me clean.\r\n\r\nA Skeleton (Level ?) head poorly attached to a stick.\r\n\r\n“That was... underwhelming.” None of the other things I used Insight on revealed much more than what they were with a single word descriptor of their quality or age. I sort of already know that my short sword was rusty. But that was just rank E! Maybe I’d become a real Sherlock Holmes when I hit rank SS+!\r\n\r\nMy cleaning continued, my skills at housecleaning in a dead city improving to the point where I could clean a whole house in just under an hour or so. I guessed. I would need a watch at some point.\r\n\r\nIf watches existed.\r\n\r\nBut airships did, so why not?\r\n\r\nI took what little stuff I had found that was useful. A nice silver candle holder with a mirrored hand protector that would keep the light out of the holder’s eyes, a pretty painting of a boat on a river with a dragon flying in the background in a nice frame, a few spoons and table knives made of silver, and tossed them all into a rough sack I found that was hole-less. They were the sum total of my riches.\r\n\r\nWhen I found civilization my first stop was going to be an antique’s store where I could sell all of the stuff and make enough to fund any future adventures!\r\n\r\nI pulled out my map and checked it out. It seemed that I had cleaned and explored the--I was going to call it Western--part of the town completely. The Evil Hole of Great Evil was just to the East of where I was, which was totally off limits because I was pretty sure the only respawn I would get was as a ghost to haunt the next poor adventurer and that wasn’t neat.\r\n\r\nMore grinding!\r\n\r\nI had to admit, cleaning had never been so much fun. Or grinding for that matter. There were real, tangible benefits to all of this and I loved every moment of it except for the moments where I was nearly dying. Those I could do without.\r\n\r\nI arrived at the southern end of the town and realized that I would need to update my map a lot. But before that, more sneaking!\r\n\r\nMoving between two homes, I kept myself low to the ground, my haversack and cleaning gear and things left next to a house behind to reduce the noise I made as I moved around.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that at some point the road leading into the town forked and never reconnected, so that the road I had been exploring for the past day and a bit was disconnected from the one I found now. This road ended at a big gate that was left ajar, just enough for someone to walk through if it wasn’t for the huge pile of branches stuffed by the entrance.\r\n\r\nThere was another well, which made three! I was right about the name!\r\n\r\nMy silent cheering at my discovery froze up when I peeked around a corner and found the old church I had seen a while ago. It was a large building with two bell towers and a small graveyard behind it. One filled with ghosts. A quick snoop revealed five glowing forms wandering in circles.\r\n\r\nFive too many.\r\n\r\nI still snooped around a little. The buildings nearest the church looked like businesses. A blacksmith’s shop, a supply store of some kind, a shop with a stick-like symbol before it. I took note of what I could see, then backed away.\r\n\r\nToo much for me to handle at my level.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was best that I just... move on. But then that would leave my quest undone, and something niggled at me about it. It didn’t have a timer, exactly, but I could tell that the longer I waited the harder things would get.\r\n\r\nNo. It was best that I stick around and at least try to see what I could do. There was another tower to visit at the far end of town. Close to the evil ghost but not on it. And there were ghosts that I might be able to chat with.\r\n\r\nAnd of course more stuff to explore.\r\n\r\nI entered a house as far from the church as could be and did my usual snoop and clean routine. Then, nearly an hour later, as the sun was setting, I used the last rays to update my map, scrubbing out mistakes with some spit and rubbing, and checked on my skill growth.\r\n\r\nInsight\r\nRank E - 14%\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank D - 84%\r\n\r\nCome morning I would hit Cleaning rank C and probably Insight rank D. Two handy skills to have, but neither combat based. Still, I wasn’t without options. I would try to lure some ghosts closer to me and take them out with Bonesy. Insight had come from repetitive actions. Cleaning from a smaller number of actions, but it was a ‘class’ skill.\r\n\r\nCinnamon Bun was obviously not a combat class, so for a fighting skill I would need a whole lot more repetitions.\r\n\r\nI could do it, I knew I could!\r\n\r\n“I believe in me!” I said.\r\n\r\n“Rrrr,” Bonsey agreed. And with that, I packed up and snuck back to the spot I’d slept in the night prior.\r\n');
INSERT INTO `capitulo` (`Chapter_ID`, `Book ID`, `Chapter Num`, `Texto`) VALUES
('Armoured and Ready', 'Cinnamon Bun', 7, '\r\n\r\nI was feeling off as I sat down at a quiet table, Bonesy propped up across from me with a spoon crunching in their mouth.\r\n\r\nThere was a spoon in my own mouth, metal clinking against my teeth and I wiggled it around and let the lingering taste of honey fade away. It took some thinking, some soul-searching, to figure out exactly what it was that bothered me.\r\n\r\nI was lonely.\r\n\r\nMy entire life had been filled with people. Friends and family and new faces that were just waiting for me to make them smile. We had moved a lot throughout my life, so I was used to parting with friends and making new ones all the time. That had to be it. This town was quiet, no one to talk to, no one to share with.\r\n\r\nBut that would change! I would accomplish my mission, the very reason I was here, then I would move on and find people. Maybe buy an airship and become sky pirate Broccoli! But without the piracy because taking other people’s stuff without permission wasn’t nice.\r\n\r\nNodding, I wiped my spoon clean, tossed it into my sack, then got things ready for a whole new day of adventuring. The sun was just starting to peak over the horizon, which meant I had all day.\r\n\r\nHopefully, by the end of the day I would be done exploring the city. Maybe I would even be strong enough to face the Evil Hole in earnest.\r\n\r\nWe’d see.\r\n\r\nFor now the plan was simple. Explore every house next to the ‘south’ wall as best I could, then move over to the shops. Something told me that I would find some much nicer loot there. Then... then I would need to find a way to get rid of all those ghosts near the church.\r\n\r\nI would try talking to them first, but if that didn’t work, then maybe I could rig up a sort of trap? I was certain there were other magical items around that I could use to injure them. Flicking magic stuff at my adversaries until they poofed wasn’t the most glorious tactic, but it might work.\r\n\r\nAll my gear was prepped, Bonesy ‘Rrr’ed’ in readiness, and I was determined to make the best of the day.\r\n\r\nThe first home I scouted was across the street from the inn at an angle. A long, low house with a roof that had once been a vibrant green before decades of missing maintenance took their toll. The door was locked, but a kick solved that problem and opened it right up.\r\n\r\nIt was dusty and a little tarnished within, but nothing I hadn’t seen, or cleaned, before. Surprisingly there was only a small fireplace tucked in a corner. No kitchen proper. The place felt unlived in. The furniture pushed to the sides, the bedroom too large for the single bed shoved up against the far wall. The bookshelf empty of any interesting looking bindings but filled with broken knick knacks.\r\n\r\nAn ancient jug. Empty\r\n\r\nI rolled my eyes, dusted the jug and moved on.\r\n\r\nThe next room was a big office, one with surprisingly few papers, but they were in good shape. There was a huge ledger-like book on the table, one that was entirely untouched by dust or grime and looked as if it had just come off the printing press. I fired an Insight at it.\r\n\r\nLedger and Accounts of the Well Inn Good, soul bound book\r\n\r\nSoul bound? That was disturbing. Taking a moment to make sure I was alone, I moved to the big book and poked it. Nothing. Then I fished out a spoon and tried to open the book.\r\n\r\nWarning! This book is Soul Bound!\r\nWarning! The Soul Binding on this book has faded. The previous owner has passed away.\r\nDo you wish to Bind your Soul to this book? Ledger and Accounts of the Well Inn Good.\r\n\r\nDid I want to play with strange and unknown magics that messed with my soul without any idea of what they did? “Nope,” I said.\r\n\r\nI dusted around the book, and over and under the desk. There was a rusty key in a drawer. I held it up and stared at it for a moment. If the book was the Inn’s ledger, than this key might be for the basement I couldn’t get into.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t cost anything to check! Then I remembered that I was an idiot and didn’t have to travel all the way over to the inn for that. “Insight.”\r\n\r\nWell Inn Good Basement Key.\r\n\r\n“Neat,” I said before tossing the key into my sack and moving on. The next house was entirely empty. Not even any furniture left behind. I didn’t get much experience in that one. The one right after wasn’t a house at all, but a sort of storage place.\r\n\r\nThe door was barred with a heavy gate that I couldn’t break through, and the windows were... well, there weren’t any. I pouted at the building, but that didn’t do anything. So I marked it on my map and moved on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next two homes were small and simple, but I could see the church through the windows, so I cleared them with as much stealth as possible. It was worth it though as I found some coins under a mattress in what might have been a sock once. One silver, some green disks that were either copper or bronze.\r\n\r\nIn the second house I found a magical device under one bed.\r\n\r\nCheap magical wand, old\r\n\r\nAll it did when I pushed magic into it was vibrate. Maybe I could use it to hurt ghosts though, so I tossed it into my sack.\r\n\r\nThen it finally happened.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Through repeated actions your Cleaning skill has improved and is now eligible for rank up!\r\nRank C costs one (1) Class Point\r\n\r\n“What?!” I said once I was done cheering (quietly). I did have a Class Point from when I levelled up, but I was loath to spend it so soon. Wasn’t I supposed to sit on skill points forever and never ever use them until I had to fight some big boss?\r\n\r\nOh well, whatever. A lost point at level one wasn’t that big a deal, I figured.\r\n\r\nSpend one (1) Class Point to raise the Rank of Cleaning to C?\r\n\r\n“Yes please,” I said.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Cleaning is now Rank C!\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank C - 00%\r\nThe ability to Clean. You are exceptionally good at tidying up and washing off. Effectiveness of cleaning is marginally increased. You may now use mana to clean things you touch.\r\n\r\nI stared, then started to giggle, and then, because I didn’t want the ghosts across the street to eat me, I slapped a hand over my mouth and ran out of the house.\r\n\r\nMy next stop was somewhere I was curious about, and where I could practice my new magic. Magic! I had magic! I didn’t so much run as skip to the Inn.\r\n\r\nThe Inn was how I had left it, deserted but surprisingly clean, like a house in bad need of some love ready to be shown off to some prospective buyers. I twirled around, skirt flaring for a moment before I refocused on my task. A bit of searching later, I had the basement key in hand and was fitting it into the lock.\r\n\r\nThe door opened with a deep groan, revealing a long room with a low ceiling. There were stones with glyphs on them fixed to the beams above, a long table in the middle of the room with a few scraps of what might have been a map, and some crates stacked up to one side. The far wall had big kegs that had probably held the wine and mead and beer that they once served here.\r\n\r\nNo ghosts, wraiths or even a rodent of unusual size.\r\n\r\nI was in the clear to explore.\r\n\r\nDeeper in, I found three stands with armour on them, each rack covered in roughly scratched glyphs. The armour looked intact as if they had been completely untouched by the passing of time.\r\n\r\nI gasped, already giddy at the idea of using magic, now doubly so if I got to wear cool armour while casting my first spells.\r\n\r\nThe first two sets looked like something I’d expect a lowly adventurer to wear.\r\n\r\nSimple steel armour, old.\r\n\r\nSimple steel plate armour, old.\r\n\r\nThey were neat, but built for someone way bigger than me. And male. The third set was more to my liking.\r\n\r\nSimple armless gambeson, old.\r\n\r\nThe thick padded cloth, all of it coloured a sort of beige, would make me look kind of chubby, that that was alright if it meant not being dead. It even had a sort of jacket above it made of a thick leather. A skirt made of long strips of leather with little brozen scales sewn into it hung below.\r\n\r\nBoiled leather jacket, old.\r\n\r\nBoiled leather skirt, old.\r\n\r\nA glance at the racks and a quick ‘Insight’ revealed how they had survived so long.\r\n\r\nMagical armour rack.\r\n\r\nI took the armour off the rack and weighted it in my arms for a bit. It was all a little heavier than my usual clothes, but that was fine. “It’s such a shame there’s no way for me to clean this poor, dirty old armour with a spell,” I said with false exasperation.\r\n\r\nI focused on my magic--the same stuff I had been using to make water with the showerhead glyph--and pushed it towards the armour. A wash of tiredness swept over me, but that was secondary to what I saw. The dirt and dust flaked off of the armour, the straps took on a faint shine and the cloth looked freshly cleaned.\r\n\r\nI laughed aloud as I spun my totally awesome new armour around. I had magic!\r\n\r\nFirst cleaning spells, next, fireballs! A quick check of my stats showed me just how much I had lost which was kind of disconcerting.\r\n\r\nMana 79/105\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of my total mana. Mana which I knew went up by about one a minute. Still, the amount of time it would have taken me to clean the armour as well as the spell had was... probably the same?\r\n\r\nI flipped the armour back and forth and looked at how clean it was, then considered how long it would take me to reach the same level of cleanliness by hand. About twenty to thirty minutes? Which was the same time it took to regenerate that mana. So it was a fair trade.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of practice I fired off the spell on the skirts and the leather jacket and lost two different amounts of mana, both lower than the gambeson alone. Neat!\r\n\r\n“What do you think, Bonesey?” I asked my skeletal friend.\r\n\r\n“Rrr,” was his bored response.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I guess you saw all sorts of magic in your day, huh?” I told it. “I hope you don’t mind, but I need to get dressed, so...” I reached over and turned Bonesy so that it was facing the far wall. As friendly as we were, well, it wasn’t so friendly that I’d let it see me getting dressed.\r\n\r\nI debated keeping my blouse on or not, but I didn’t want to armour to chafe and the soft cotton of my blouse would keep my skin safe. Still, I took it off and winced at how dirty it had become. Oh, if only I had a solution to that.\r\n\r\nA few more points of mana down the drain and I had a perfectly spotless blouse. One that I was going to wear over skin that hadn’t seen a shower in two and a bit days. Yuck.\r\n\r\nAnother drain of mana and I gasped. I was... clean. Very clean. I was clean all over. ”Oh, wow,” I said as I shifted around. “That’s... refreshing.”\r\n\r\nMana 42/105\r\n\r\nI shrugged and fired off another cleaning spell at my skirt, because I could. Then slid back into my blouse. It felt... itchy. Had I just exfoliated my everything? I had to be careful with this great power.\r\n\r\nStill, it wouldn’t be right not to share!\r\n\r\n“Hey Bonesy, how you you like to be the cleanest, leanest skeleton on this side of... wherever we are?”\r\n\r\n“Rrr?”\r\n\r\n“Uh huh,” I said as I placed one finger onto the bony skull and pushed.\r\n\r\nMagic flowed out of me.\r\n\r\nBonesey shifted, jaw opening, then hanging slack as a ghostly form, just a head and the hint of shoulders, appeared out of the skull.\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have sent ‘Bonesy. Skeletal Bard’ Level 3 beyond the veil! Bonus Exp was granted for cleansing a monster above your level!\r\n\r\n“Bonesy!” I shouted.\r\n\r\nThe ghostly afterimage above the skull floated up, taking the shape of a man’s face. “Thank you,” he whispered before fading away.\r\n\r\nMy knees crashing into the dusty ground.\r\n\r\n“Bonesy! No, no, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”\r\n'),
('Beneath the Crescent Moon', 'Beware of Chicken', 3, 'Bi De knew fury. One of the red ones had vexed his Great Master. It had nearly slain one of the Great Master’s flocks, somehow managing to sneak past him. He barely sound the alarm in time, his voice berating the foul interloper.\r\n\r\nBut this red one, this vile beast, was skilled. It danced around his blows, and even, horror of horrors, evaded the Great Master’s mighty spur, the one that he used to tame the earth. In all other cases, his iron spur had been a command of death. With a single contemptuous blow, he smote all others.\r\n\r\nBut not for this one.\r\n\r\nAt first, he was stunned nearly to the point of spitting blood. Why did his Great Master not pursue? He could have easily slain the interloper, this demon, if he directed his full and terrible wrath against it.\r\n\r\nHe did not understand, but he knew his Great Master had wisdom that far eclipsed his.\r\n\r\nThrice, the foulspawn did attempt to take what was rightfully the Great Master’s. Thrice, did the Great Master’s mighty blow miss.\r\n\r\nHe even gave it a name from the very pits of hell: Basi Bu Shi. Bi De shuddered whenever he heard it. His Great Master’s words of power contained both virtuous and fell wisdom.\r\n\r\nBut now, he understood. He had figured out the conundrum his Great Master had set before him. His Great Master had once more bought out his mobile coop. He remembered vaguely, before he was enlightened, travelling to these blessed lands upon the mighty fortress from the…. other place that was more hazy.\r\n\r\nSome of his master’s supplies had run low. He wished to return to the other place, so that the people there may give tribute to his glory.\r\n\r\nBut to travel outwards, he would have to leave his home. With only Bi De as it’s guardian.\r\n\r\nAnd he was not strong enough. His weakness was preventing the master from living how he wished. It was unacceptable.\r\n\r\nHe had been issued a challenge, in Basi Bu Shi’s continued existence. A mighty task to prove his worth against the wicked.\r\n\r\nAnd so he redoubled his efforts. His kicks took on new energy. His dance, new grace. He would slay this mighty enemy, and earn his Great Master’s trust.\r\n\r\nThe Great Pillars of The Fa Ram called.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nWell, just a bit more till I head back to Verdant Hill. I’d have to take the chickens along with me, so they didn’t all get eaten. I should probably finally deal with Basil Brush. I was being kind of lazy about it, just chasing him off and hoping he would get the message, but he was becoming persistent.\r\n\r\nI squinted at Big D as I finished dressing the fox pelt.\r\n\r\nWas…. Was my fucking chicken doing a training montage?\r\n\r\nI watched his incredibly crisp kicks for a little longer.\r\n\r\nI shook my head. Nah, I had spent too long alone. Humanising him a bit too much. Or its just cultivator world bullshit.\r\n\r\nAlright, tomorrow I’ll hunt Basil down.\r\n\r\nHeheheh. Boom Boom.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nTonight, he would slay wicked Basi Bu Shi.\r\n\r\nTonight, it would be either glory–or his death. Either were acceptable. If he fell in this battle, it merely proved that he was unworthy of his Great Master’s continued sufferance.\r\n\r\nHe went into the night, hopping from tree to tree in silence. And there, he found his quarry.\r\n\r\nThe beast was arrogant. It stalked, but did not realise others could stalk it.\r\n\r\nIn silence, Bi De descended, and he struck. His legs lashed with great strength, and his enemy snarled in pain.\r\n\r\nHe struck again to press his advantage, but Basi Bu Shi was worthy of his master’s ire, the lithe creature shooting away, but with a deep scar in it’s flesh that leaked blood.\r\n\r\nBi De saw it, in his mortal enemy’s eyes. The spark of awareness. The spark of fury.\r\n\r\nThis one… this one knew too.\r\n\r\nHis foe did not run. It knew he had not called his Great Master. It knew it could lay him low here.\r\n\r\nTheir silent dance began.\r\n\r\nHis legs and spurs cut through the night air, as he flipped and dashed around his enemy’s razor teeth and tearing claws.\r\n\r\nIt tried to strike him with it’s limbs, to foul his footing and drive him to the earth, but he had grown wise to these beast’s tricks, dodging them when he could, and accepting the blow to gain distance when he couldn’t.\r\n\r\nThe two whirls of red chased each other through the trees, bouncing off trees, and leaving scratches in the forest floor.\r\n\r\nBi De felt triumph. He was equally matched with this one– nay, he dared think himself it’s superior. It’s nose was slashed open, one of it’s ears a ragged mass.His spurs ran crimson.\r\n\r\nBut the wicked one could have tricks too. It raised it’s limb, as to strike another blow, sending his wings snapping out to redirect hit momentum.\r\n\r\nHe saw the gleam of satisfaction too late.\r\n\r\nThe paw slammed down instead, launching the wicked one forwards, and the vile Basi Bu Shi became a streamer of red, trailing behind an open maw.\r\n\r\nTeeth crashed down upon his wing. The wicked one shook it’s head savagely, and then threw him across the clearing, to slam into a tree.\r\n\r\nIt was pain like no other. He nearly cried out, he nearly summoned his Great Master, but he refused to. This was his test, and he refused to fail.\r\n\r\nHe staggered to get up, his legs shaking with the effort. But it was for nought.\r\n\r\nBasi Bu Shi drove him to the earth with his mighty paw. He laughed over besting the Great Master’s disciple. He savoured his victory.\r\n\r\nBi De knew only shame, as he lied there, pinned to the base earth. He could not return his Great Master’s Blessings. He could not ever repay him. All he could do is stare up at the night sky in torment.\r\n\r\nThe enormous crescent moon loomed in his vision. It was his favourite phase of the celestial object, and he always contemplated it when it showed its most perfect form. It looked somewhat like his master’s mighty spur– or his own useless, weak ones.\r\n\r\nAh, how he wished for a mighty weapon to slay the wicked.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent Moon loomed.\r\n\r\nBi De, in his last moments, contemplated the lunar glory.\r\n\r\nBi De, in his last moments, understood.\r\n\r\nHe guided his energy and intent true. Blades of light, pure as the moon above, sprung from his limbs.\r\n\r\n[Rising of the Crescent Moon]\r\n\r\nHis body sprung from it’s prone position and he rose as surely as the moon. The wicked could not contain him with it’s paltry strength. The blade struck true, gouging out one of the foulspawn’s eyes as he flipped in the air.\r\n\r\nThe enemy shrieked in pain, its very soul burned by the righteous, heavenly blades he now bore.\r\n\r\nHe hung there a moment, under the moon’s celestial light, gazing down upon his enemy.\r\n\r\nAll things that rise, fall.\r\n\r\n[Descending Lunar Fangs]\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable, as true as the sun, the moon, and the stars set, so too did he once more descend to the base earth, carrying the weight and glory of heaven with him.\r\n\r\nBoth of his glimmering spurs buried themselves in the neck of the red one. This unsightly Basi Bu Shi.\r\n\r\n[Wheel of the Crescent Moon]\r\n\r\nHis legs split apart, once more throwing him into a flip, the white energy forming a ring-like afterimage around him, and parting his mortal enemy’s head from it’s shoulders.\r\n\r\nHe landed gracefully once more upon the earth.\r\n\r\nHis enemy’s head thumped to the ground behind him.\r\n\r\nHe.. he had done it. Bi De had completed his master’s task.\r\n\r\nHe roared his victory to the heavens.\r\n\r\nHis Great Master burst into the clearing upon hearing his cry, fury in his eyes at those who would dare attempt to harm his disciple.\r\n\r\n//////////\r\n\r\nI stumbled to a stop, after once again being called out of bed. The small clearing was cut up from something, and there was Big D, looking pleased as punch, standing on the savaged and beheaded form of Basil Brush.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck?\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nHis Great Master, as always, lavished affection upon him. His broken wing was bandaged. His messed feathers combed, and his wattles rubbed in a most pleasing way.\r\n\r\nHe was delivered back to the coop, and fed full sprigs of Heavenly Herbs. His Great Master Commanded him to replenish, and enjoy himself.\r\n\r\nHe was a good disciple of his Great Master. He had passed his test, and was now to be granted guardianship of The Great Fa Ram, trusted to hold faith for his Lord while he braved the world. \r\n'),
('Chapter 1', 'Snow Crash', 1, 'The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory. He\'s got esprit\r\nup to here. Right now, he is preparing to carry out his third mission of the night.\r\nHis uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air.\r\nA bullet will bounce off its arachnofiber weave like a wren hitting a patio door,\r\nbut excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed\r\nforest. Where his body has bony extremities, the suit has sintered armorgel: feels\r\nlike gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books.\r\nWhen they gave him the job, they gave him a gun. The Deliverator never\r\ndeals in cash, but someone might come after him anyway—might want his car,\r\nor his cargo. The gun is tiny, aero-styled, lightweight, the kind of a gun a fashion\r\ndesigner would carry; it fires teensy darts that fly at five times the velocity of an\r\nSR-71 spy plane, and when you get done using it, you have to plug it into the\r\ncigarette lighter, because it runs on electricity.\r\nThe Deliverator never pulled that gun in anger, or in fear. He pulled it once in\r\nGila Highlands. Some punks in Gila Highlands, a fancy Burbclave, wanted\r\nthemselves a delivery, and they didn\'t want to pay for it. Thought they would\r\nimpress the Deliverator with a baseball bat. The Deliverator took out his gun,\r\ncentered its laser doo-hickey on that poised Louisville Slugger, fired it. The\r\nrecoil was immense, as though the weapon had blown up in his hand. The\r\nmiddle third of the baseball bat turned into a column of burning sawdust\r\naccelerating in all directions like a bursting star. Punk ended up holding this bat\r\nhandle with milky smoke pouring out the end. Stupid look on his face. Didn\'t get\r\nnothing but trouble from the Deliverator.\r\nSince then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment and\r\nrelied, instead, on a matched set of samurai swords, which have always been his\r\nweapon of choice anyhow. The punks in Gila Highlands weren\'t afraid of the\r\ngun, so the Deliverator was forced to use it. But swords need no demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThe Deliverator\'s car has enough potential energy packed into its batteries to\r\nfire a pound of bacon into the Asteroid Belt. Unlike a bimbo box or a Burb\r\nbeater, the Deliverator\'s car unloads that power through gaping, gleaming,\r\npolished sphincters. When the Deliverator puts the hammer down, shit happens.\r\nYou want to talk contact patches? Your car\'s tires have tiny contact patches, talk\r\nto the asphalt in four places the size of your tongue. The Deliverator\'s car has big\r\nsticky tires with contact patches the size of a fat lady\'s thighs. The Deliverator is\r\nin touch with the road, starts like a bad day, stops on a peseta.\r\nWhy is the Deliverator so equipped? Because people rely on him. He is a roll\r\nmodel. This is America. People do whatever the fuck they feel like doing, you\r\ngot a problem with that? Because they have a right to. And because they have\r\nguns and no one can fucking stop them. As a result, this country has one of the\r\nworst economies in the world. When it gets down to it—talking trade balances\r\nhere—once we\'ve brain-drained all our technology into other countries, once\r\nthings have evened out, they\'re making cars in Bolivia and microwave ovens in\r\nTadzhikistan and selling them here—once our edge in natural resources has been\r\nmade irrelevant by giant Hong Kong ships and dirigibles that can ship North\r\nDakota all the way to New Zealand for a nickel—once the Invisible Hand has\r\ntaken all those historical inequities and smeared them out into a broad global\r\nlayer of what a Pakistani brickmaker would consider to be prosperity—y\'know\r\nwhat? There\'s only four things we do better than anyone else\r\nmusic\r\nmovies\r\nmicrocode (software)\r\nhigh-speed pizza delivery\r\nThe Deliverator used to make software. Still does, sometimes. But if life were\r\na mellow elementary school run by well-meaning education Ph.D.s, the\r\nDeliverator\'s report card would say: “Hiro is so bright and creative but needs to9\r\nwork harder on his cooperation skills.”\r\nSo now he has this other job. No brightness or creativity involved—but no\r\ncooperation either. Just a single principle: The Deliverator stands tall, your pie in\r\nthirty minutes or you can have it free, shoot the driver, take his car, file a class-\r\naction suit. The Deliverator has been working this job for six months, a rich and\r\nlengthy tenure by his standards, and has never delivered a pizza in more than\r\ntwenty-one minutes.\r\nOh, they used to argue over times, many corporate driver-years lost to it:\r\nhomeowners, red-faced and sweaty with their own lies, stinking of Old Spice\r\nand job-related stress, standing in their glowing yellow doorways brandishing\r\ntheir Seikos and waving at the clock over the kitchen sink, I swear, can\'t you\r\nguys tell time?\r\nDidn\'t happen anymore. Pizza delivery is a major industry. A managed\r\nindustry. People went to CosaNostra Pizza University four years just to learn it.\r\nCame in its doors unable to write an English sentence, from Abkhazia, Rwanda,\r\nGuanajuato, South Jersey, and came out knowing more about pizza than a\r\nBedouin knows about sand. And they had studied this problem. Graphed the\r\nfrequency of doorway delivery-time disputes. Wired the early Deliverators to\r\nrecord, then analyze, the debating tactics, the voice-stress histograms, the\r\ndistinctive grammatical structures employed by white middle-class Type A\r\nBurbclave occupants who against all logic had decided that this was the place to\r\ntake their personal Custerian stand against all that was stale and deadening in\r\ntheir lives: they were going to lie, or delude themselves, about the time of their\r\nphone call and get themselves a free pizza; no, they deserved a free pizza along\r\nwith their life, liberty, and pursuit of whatever, it was fucking inalienable. Sent\r\npsychologists out to these people\'s houses, gave them a free TV set to submit to\r\nan anonymous interview, hooked them to polygraphs, studied their brain waves\r\nas they showed them choppy, inexplicable movies of porn queens and late-night\r\ncar crashes and Sammy Davis, Jr., put them in sweet-smelling, mauve-walled\r\nrooms and asked them questions about Ethics so perplexing that even a Jesuit\r\ncouldn\'t respond without committing a venial sin.\r\nThe analysts at CosaNostra Pizza University concluded that it was just human\r\nnature and you couldn\'t fix it, and so they went for a quick cheap technical fix:\r\nsmart boxes. The pizza box is a plastic carapace now, corrugated for stiffness, a10\r\nlittle LED readout glowing on the side, telling the Deliverator how many trade\r\nimbalance-producing minutes have ticked away since the fateful phone call.\r\nThere are chips and stuff in there. The pizzas rest, a short stack of them, in slots\r\nbehind the Deliverator\'s head. Each pizza glides into a slot like a circuit board\r\ninto a computer, clicks into place as the smart box interfaces with the onboard\r\nsystem of the Deliverator\'s car. The address of the caller has already been\r\ninferred from his phone number and poured into the smart box\'s built-in RAM.\r\nFrom there it is communicated to the car, which computes and projects the\r\noptimal route on a heads-up display, a glowing colored map traced out against\r\nthe windshield so that the Deliverator does not even have to glance down.\r\nIf the thirty-minute deadline expires, news of the disaster is flashed to\r\nCosaNostra Pizza Headquarters and relayed from there to Uncle Enzo himself—\r\nthe Sicilian Colonel Sanders, the Andy Griffith of Bensonhurst, the straight\r\nrazor-swinging figment of many a Deliverator\'s nightmares, the Capo and prime\r\nfigurehead of CosaNostra Pizza, Incorporated—who will be on the phone to the\r\ncustomer within five minutes, apologizing profusely. The next day, Uncle Enzo\r\nwill land on the customer\'s yard in a jet helicopter and apologize some more and\r\ngive him a free trip to Italy—all he has to do is sign a bunch of releases that\r\nmake him a public figure and spokesperson for CosaNostra Pizza and basically\r\nend his private life as he knows it. He will come away from the whole thing\r\nfeeling that, somehow, he owes the Mafia a favor.\r\nThe Deliverator does not know for sure what happens to the driver in such\r\ncases, but he has heard some rumors. Most pizza deliveries happen in the\r\nevening hours, which Uncle Enzo considers to be his private time. And how\r\nwould you feel if you had to interrupt dinner with your family in order to call\r\nsome obstreperous dork in a Burbclave and grovel for a late fucking pizza?\r\nUncle Enzo has not put in fifty years serving his family and his country so that,\r\nat the age when most are playing golf and bobbling their granddaughters, he can\r\nget out of the bathtub dripping wet and lie down and kiss the feet of some\r\nsixteen-year-old skate punk whose pepperoni was thirty-one minutes in coming.\r\nOh, God. It makes the Deliverator breathe a little shallower just to think of the\r\nidea.\r\nBut he wouldn\'t drive for CosaNostra Pizza any other way. You know why?\r\nBecause there\'s something about having your life on the line. It\'s like being a\r\nkamikaze pilot. Your mind is clear. Other people—store clerks, burger flippers,11\r\nsoftware engineers, the whole vocabulary of meaningless jobs that make up Life\r\nin America—other people just rely on plain old competition. Better flip your\r\nburgers or debug your subroutines faster and better than your high school\r\nclassmate two blocks down the strip is flipping or debugging, because we\'re in\r\ncompetition with those guys, and people notice these things.\r\nWhat a fucking rat race that is. CosaNostra Pizza doesn\'t have any\r\ncompetition. Competition goes against the Mafia ethic. You don\'t work harder\r\nbecause you\'re competing against some identical operation down the street. You\r\nwork harder because everything is on the line. Your name, your honor, your\r\nfamily, your life. Those burger flippers might have a better life expectancy—but\r\nwhat kind of life is it anyway, you have to ask yourself. That\'s why nobody, not\r\neven the Nipponese, can move pizzas faster than CosaNostra. The Deliverator is\r\nproud to wear the uniform, proud to drive the car, proud to march up the front\r\nwalks of innumerable Burbclave homes, a grim vision in ninja black, a pizza on\r\nhis shoulder, red LED digits blazing proud numbers into the night: 12:32 or\r\n15:15 or the occasional 20:43.\r\nThe Deliverator is assigned to CosaNostra Pizza #3569 in the Valley. Southern\r\nCalifornia doesn\'t know whether to bustle or just strangle itself on the spot. Not\r\nenough roads for the number of people. Fairlanes, Inc. is laying new ones all the\r\ntime. Have to bulldoze lots of neighborhoods to do it, but those seventies and\r\neighties developments exist to be bulldozed, right? No sidewalks, no schools, no\r\nnothing. Don\'t have their own police force—no immigration control—\r\nundesirables can walk right in without being frisked or even harassed. Now a\r\nBurbclave, that\'s the place to live. A city-state with its own constitution, a\r\nborder, laws, cops, everything.\r\nThe Deliverator was a corporal in the Farms of Merryvale State Security\r\nForce for a while once. Got himself fired for pulling a sword on an\r\nacknowledged perp. Slid it right through the fabric of the perp\'s shirt, gliding the\r\nflat of the blade along the base of his neck, and pinned him to a warped and\r\nbubbled expanse of vinyl siding on the wall of the house that the perp was trying\r\nto break into. Thought it was a pretty righteous bust. But they fired him anyway\r\nbecause the perp turned out to be the son of the vice-chancellor of the Farms of\r\nMerryvale. Oh, the weasels had an excuse: said that a thirty-six-inch samurai\r\nsword was not on their Weapons Protocol. Said that he had violated the SPAC,\r\nthe Suspected Perpetrator Apprehension Code. Said that the perp had suffered12\r\npsychological trauma. He was afraid of butter knives now; he had to spread his\r\njelly with the back of a teaspoon. They said that he had exposed them to liability.\r\nThe Deliverator had to borrow some money to pay for it. Had to borrow it\r\nfrom the Mafia, in fact. So he\'s in their database now—retinal patterns, DNA,\r\nvoice graph, fingerprints, footprints, palm prints, wrist prints, every fucking part\r\nof the body that had wrinkles on it—almost—those bastards rolled in ink and\r\nmade a print and digitized it into their computer. But it\'s their money—sure\r\nthey\'re careful about loaning it out. And when he applied for the Deliverator job\r\nthey were happy to take him, because they knew him. When he got the loan, he\r\nhad to deal personally with the assistant vice-capo of the Valley, who later\r\nrecommended him for the Deliverator job. So it was like being in a family. A\r\nreally scary, twisted, abusive family.\r\nCosaNostra Pizza #3569 is on Vista Road just down from Kings Park Mall.\r\nVista Road used to belong to the State of California and now is called Fairlanes,\r\nInc. Rte. CSV-5. Its main competition used to be a U.S. highway and is now\r\ncalled Cruiseways, Inc. Rte. Cal-12. Farther up the Valley, the two competing\r\nhighways actually cross. Once there had been bitter disputes, the intersection\r\nclosed by sporadic sniper fire. Finally, a big developer bought the entire\r\nintersection and turned it into a drive-through mall. Now the roads just feed into\r\na parking system—not a lot, not a ramp, but a system—and lose their identity.\r\nGetting through the intersection involves tracing paths through the parking\r\nsystem, many braided filaments of direction like the Ho Chi Minh trail. CSV-5\r\nhas better throughput, but Cal-12 has better pavement. That is typical—Fairlanes\r\nroads emphasize getting you there, for Type A drivers, and Cruiseways\r\nemphasize the enjoyment of the ride, for Type B drivers.\r\nThe Deliverator is a Type A driver with rabies. He is zeroing in on his home\r\nbase, CosaNostra Pizza #3569, cranking up the left lane of CSV-5 at a hundred\r\nand twenty kilometers. His car is an invisible black lozenge, just a dark place\r\nthat reflects the tunnel of franchise signs—the loglo. A row of orange lights\r\nburbles and churns across the front, where the grille would be if this were an air-\r\nbreathing car. The orange light looks like a gasoline fire. It comes in through\r\npeople\'s rear windows, bounces off their rearview mirrors, projects a fiery mask\r\nacross their eyes, reaches into their subconscious, and unearths terrible fears of\r\nbeing pinned, fully conscious, under a detonating gas tank, makes them want to\r\npull over and let the Deliverator overtake them in his black chariot of pepperoni13\r\nfire.\r\nThe loglo, overhead, marking out CSV-5 in twin contrails, is a body of\r\nelectrical light made of innumerable cells, each cell designed in Manhattan by\r\nimageers who make more for designing a single logo than a Deliverator will\r\nmake in his entire lifetime. Despite their efforts to stand out, they all smear\r\ntogether, especially at a hundred and twenty kilometers per hour. Still, it is easy\r\nto see CosaNostra Pizza #3569 because of the billboard, which is wide and tall\r\neven by current inflated standards. In fact, the squat franchise itself looks like\r\nnothing more than a low-slung base for the great aramid fiber pillars that thrust\r\nthe billboard up into the trademark firmament. Marca Registrada, baby.\r\nThe billboard is a classic, a chestnut, not a figment of some fleeting Mafia\r\npromotional campaign. It is a statement, a monument built to endure. Simple and\r\ndignified. It shows Uncle Enzo in one of his spiffy Italian suits. The pinstripes\r\nglint and flex like sinews. The pocket square is luminous. His hair is perfect,\r\nslicked back with something that never comes off, each strand cut off straight\r\nand square at the end by Uncle Enzo\'s cousin, Art the Barber, who runs the\r\nsecond-largest chain of low-end haircutting establishments in the world. Uncle\r\nEnzo is standing there, not exactly smiling, an avuncular glint in his eye for sure,\r\nnot posing like a model but standing there like your uncle would, and it says\r\nThe Mafia\r\nyou\'ve got a friend in The Family!\r\npaid for by the Our Thing Foundation\r\nThe billboard serves as the Deliverator\'s polestar. He knows that when he gets\r\nto the place on CSV-5 where the bottom corner of the billboard is obscured by\r\nthe pseudo-Gothic stained-glass arches of the local Reverend Wayne\'s Pearly\r\nGates franchise, it\'s time for him to get over into the right lanes where the retards\r\nand the bimbo boxes poke along, random, indecisive, looking at each passing\r\nfranchise\'s driveway like they don\'t know if it\'s a promise or a threat.14\r\nHe cuts off a bimbo box—a family minivan—veers past the Buy \'n\' Fly that is\r\nnext door, and pulls into CosaNostra Pizza #3569. Those big fat contact patches\r\ncomplain, squeal a little bit, but they hold on to the patented Fairlanes, Inc. high-\r\ntraction pavement and guide him into the chute. No other Deliverators are\r\nwaiting in the chute. That is good, that means high turnover for him, fast action,\r\nkeep moving that \'za. As he scrunches to a stop, the electromechanical hatch on\r\nthe flank of his car is already opening to reveal his empty pizza slots, the door\r\nclicking and folding back in on itself like the wing of a beetle. The slots are\r\nwaiting. Waiting for hot pizza.\r\nAnd waiting. The Deliverator honks his horn. This is not a nominal outcome.\r\nWindow slides open. That should never happen. You can look at the three-ring\r\nbinder from CosaNostra Pizza University, cross-reference the citation for\r\nwindow, chute, dispatcher\'s, and it will give you all the procedures for that\r\nwindow—and it should never be opened. Unless something has gone wrong.\r\nThe window slides open and—you sitting down?—smoke comes out of it. The\r\nDeliverator hears a discordant beetling over the metal hurricane of his sound\r\nsystem and realizes that it is a smoke alarm, coming from inside the franchise.\r\nMute button on the stereo. Oppressive silence—his eardrums uncringe—the\r\nwindow is buzzing with the cry of the smoke alarm. The car idles, waiting. The\r\nhatch has been open too long, atmospheric pollutants are congealing on the\r\nelectrical contacts in the back of the pizza slots, he\'ll have to clean them ahead of\r\nschedule, everything is going exactly the way it shouldn\'t go in the three-ring\r\nbinder that spells out all the rhythms of the pizza universe.\r\nInside, a football-shaped Abkhazian man is running to and fro, holding a\r\nthree-ring binder open, using his spare tire as a ledge to keep it from collapsing\r\nshut; he runs with the gait of a man carrying an egg on a spoon. He is shouting in\r\nthe Abkhazian dialect; all the people who run CosaNostra pizza franchises in this\r\npart of the Valley are Abkhazian immigrants.\r\nIt does not look like a serious fire. The Deliverator saw a real fire once, at the\r\nFarms of Merryvale, and you couldn\'t see anything for the smoke. That\'s all it\r\nwas: smoke, burbling out of nowhere, occasional flashes of orange light down at\r\nthe bottom, like heat lightning in tall clouds. This is not that kind of fire. It is the15\r\n');

('Cheaters', 'Mother of Learning', 9, '“Majara,” intoned Zorian, finishing the spell with the word he wanted the spell to search for. He felt the spell reach out around him, scanning the books in the surrounding shelves for any mention of the word in question, and poured some more mana into the spell to expand its radius. His efforts to overcharge the spell almost unraveled it, forcing him to spend several seconds stabilizing the spell boundary, but in the end the mana flow snapped into its proper place and the spell finished its task as planned. Seven golden threads flickered into existence, seemingly growing out of his chest and connecting him to various books in this particular section of the library.\r\n\r\nZorian smiled. The spell was one of the book divinations Ibery had taught him, one that sought out books containing a specified word or string of words. It was a somewhat fragile spell, failing if the number of positive matches exceeded a certain number – the exact number depending on the caster’s skill. It was mostly used to search for quotes or really exotic terms.\r\n\r\nExotic terms like, say, the dead language of Majara. Zenomir hadn’t been kidding when he had told Zorian that he wouldn’t be able to find any books about it – there were no books specifically about the Majara language, and very few books even mentioned it. Up until now, he had only found 13 other books that contained the word, and most of them only in the form of a throwaway comment or two. It was possible that the knowledge he sought existed somewhere in the library, only in a format that was invisible to the divinations he was using – Ibery had only taught him the very basics of ‘library magic’, as she called it, so his searches were painfully crude in the grand scheme of things – but if that was the case, there was little he could do about it.\r\n\r\nHe glanced down at the threads growing out of his chest and waved his hand through them, watching it pass through them without effect. He never got tired of doing that. Well, he probably would, in time, but the novelty hadn’t worn off yet. The threads were an illusion, existing only in the privacy of his own mind. Every divination spell needed a medium through which it could present information to the caster, since it was impossible for human minds to process the raw output of a divination spell. A self-imposed illusion like the threads he was currently looking at was actually fairly advanced as divination mediums go, or so Ibery had claimed when he had tried to tell her he got the spell working within 30 minutes of being shown how to do it. He had a distinct impression she thought he was lying. He didn’t really understand what was supposed to be so difficult about it, to be honest – the threads were a purely mental construct that didn’t even require much in the way of shaping skills… just visualization. It seemed pretty simple to him. Natural even.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and followed after one of the golden threads till he reached a book it was attached to. It was a huge, intimidating, 400-page book about the history of Miasina, and Zorian had absolutely no intention of poring over it until he reached the tiny part that actually interested him, so he cast another divination Ibery had taught him. This one highlighted every mention of the chosen word (in this case ‘Majara’) in shining green, so he simply flipped through the book till he caught a flash of green.\r\n\r\n“Zorian? What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\nZorian immediately snapped the book shut and stuffed it back on the shelf. While he wasn’t doing anything forbidden, he really didn’t want to explain to Ibery what Majara was, and why he was searching the library for any mention of it.\r\n\r\nThe retort he planned to use died on his lips when he finally turned to get a good look on his visitor. Ibery was a mess. Her eyes and nose were red, as if she had been crying recently, and there was an ugly purple splotch covering her right cheek and neck. It didn’t look like a bruise, not exactly, more like…\r\n\r\nOh hell no.\r\n\r\n“Ibery…” he started hesitantly. “You wouldn’t happen to go in the same class as my brother, would you?”\r\n\r\nShe flinched back and looked away. He sighed heavily. Just great.\r\n\r\n“How did you know?” she asked after a second of silence.\r\n\r\n“Brother dearest came to me earlier today,” said Zorian. “Said he pushed a girl into a purple creeper patch and wanted me to make ‘an anti-rash potion’. I wasn’t in the mood so I kind of blew him off.”\r\n\r\nThat was a lie, actually. He had discovered, during the last three reverts, that Fortov was either unable or unwilling to track him down if he failed to return to his room after class. That was actually the main reason why he spent the entire day in the library instead of inside his room. Still, due to his rather unique situation he knew what would have happened had he been present.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said quietly. “That…. That’s alright.”\r\n\r\n“No,” disagreed Zorian. “No, it’s not. If I had known he was talking about you, I would have helped him out. Well… helped you out. He can go die in a fire as far as I’m concerned.” He paused for a moment, considering things. “You know, there is no reason why I can’t do it now. I’ll just have to stop by my room to pick up the ingredients and-”\r\n\r\n“You don’t have to do that,” Ibery quickly interrupted. “It’s… not that important.”\r\n\r\nZorian took in her appearance one more time. Yup, she had definitely been crying before coming here. Besides, her choice of words was conspicuous – she said that he didn’t have to do it, not that he shouldn’t, and that it wasn\'t that important, not that it wasn’t.\r\n\r\n“It’s not really a problem,” he assured her. “The main reason I refused in the first place is because it was Fortov who asked, not because it was so difficult to do. Just tell me where to find you when I’m done.”\r\n\r\n“Um, I’d like to come with you, if it’s not a problem,” she said hesitantly. “I’d like to see how the cure is made. Just in case.”\r\n\r\nZorian paused. That was... potentially problematic. After all, the alchemical workshop would be closed down this late in the evening, and he would have to employ some, uh, unorthodox methods of gaining access. But what the hell, it wasn’t like she would remember this in the next restart.\r\n\r\nThus they set off towards Zorian’s apartment. Of course, having Ibery looking over his shoulder wasn’t enough, so when he had finally reached his room he found another familiar person waiting for him. Specifically, Zach.\r\n\r\nHe wasn’t terribly surprised to see Zach waiting for him, to be honest. The boy had been getting steadily more nervous during their practice sessions as the summer festival approached, no doubt unnerved by the impeding invasion. Not that he ever told Zorian about the invasion – Zach was stubbornly tight-lipped about that, regardless of how much Zorian tried to goad him into blurting out something. Over the last few days, his fellow time traveler had questioned him about his plans for the summer festival several times, not-so-subtly implying that staying inside his room would be a bad idea. As Zorian still remembered quite vividly how one of the ‘flares’ flattened his entire apartment building when the invasion started, he was inclined to agree with Zach on that one. Unfortunately, Zach seemed to have trouble believing that Zorian was in agreement with him on that point. No doubt he came specifically to make sure (again) that Zorian was going to attend the dance. Zorian wondered, for god knows what time, just what happened between Zach and his previous incarnations to produce this kind of impression. Had he really been that stubborn before the time loop?\r\n\r\nHe walked up to Zach, who was sitting on the floor next to his door, completely oblivious to his surroundings while he concentrated on something on his palm. No, now that he got closer he could see it was actually something above his palm. A pencil, lazily spinning in the air above Zach’s palm. Apparently Zach knew the pen spinning exercise too, and was currently practicing it while he waited. Zorian had a strong urge to throw a marble at Zach’s forehead and demand that he starts over, but decided against it.\r\n\r\nMostly because he didn’t have any marbles on his person at the moment.\r\n\r\n“Hello Zach,” Zorian said, startling Zach out of his reverie. “Are you waiting for me?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” confirmed Zach. He opened his mouth to say something else but then noticed Ibery trailing behind Zorian and snapped his mouth shut. “Err, am I interrupting something?”\r\n\r\n“No, not really,” Zorian sighed. “I just came to grab some alchemical supplies and then I’ll go make something for miss Ambercomb here. What did you want with me?”\r\n\r\n“Eh, it can wait a while,” Zach said dismissively. “What are you making? Maybe I can help – I’m pretty good at alchemy.”\r\n\r\n“Is there anything you’re not good at?” asked Zorian with a snort.\r\n\r\n“You’d be surprised,” mumbled Zach.\r\n\r\nIbery watched their interaction in silence, but Zach was a fairly sociable person, so by the time Zorian returned from his room with a box of supplies the two of them were engaged in lively conversation. Mostly about Ibery’s current condition.\r\n\r\n“Man, I didn’t know your brother is such a jerk, Zorian,” Zach remarked. “No wonder you turned out to be such a… uh…”\r\n\r\nHe trailed off when Zorian raised his eyebrow at him, daring him to finish that sentence. Ibery’s reaction was more vocal.\r\n\r\n“He’s not a jerk!” she protested. “He didn’t mean for this to happen.”\r\n\r\n“He should have fixed it, though,” Zach insisted. “Intentionally or not, it was his fault. He shouldn’t have dumped his responsibility on his little brother like this.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody forced Zorian to do anything,” Ibery said. “He’s doing this out of his own free will. Right, Zorian?”\r\n\r\n“Right,” agreed Zorian. “I’m doing this because I want to.”\r\n\r\nHe actually agreed with Zach, but chose not to say so. If he had learned anything about Ibery from spending an entire revert around her it was that she had a massive crush on Fortov. No good could come from bad mouthing him in front of her. Besides, if he was to be honest with himself, Zorian had to admit he was incapable of being objective about Fortov. There was too much bad blood between the two of them.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the two of them quickly agreed to disagree on the topic and a comfortable silence descended on the group. Well, it was comfortable for Zorian – apparently Zach didn’t agree.\r\n\r\n“Hey, Zorian,” Zach said. “Why are we going towards the academy proper?”\r\n\r\n“So I can access the alchemical workshop, of course,” said Zorian. He knew what Zach was getting at, of course, but he was still hoping to get away without revealing one of his most closely guarded tricks.\r\n\r\nNo such luck.\r\n\r\n“But all the workshops are closed this late in the evening,” remarked Zach.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Ibery exclaimed. “He’s right! They closed down two hours ago!”\r\n\r\n“It won’t be a problem,” Zorian assured them. “So long as we clean up after ourselves, no one will know we were there.”\r\n\r\n“But the door is locked,” pointed out Zach.\r\n\r\nZorian sighed. “Not to magic, it isn’t.”\r\n\r\n“You know unlocking spells?” asked Zach in a surprised tone.\r\n\r\nZorian understood his surprise – unlocking spells were restricted magic, due to their obvious abuse potential. Unless you possessed a special license, even knowing how to cast them was a crime. Not a particularly serious crime, but a crime nonetheless.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was good, then, that Zorian didn’t know a single unlocking spell.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t,” said Zorian. “But it’s just a simple mechanical lock. I’ll just manipulate the tumblers telekinetically. Piece of cake.”\r\n\r\nThey gave him a blank look. Like most people, they had no idea how locks actually worked, and how easy it was to bypass most of them. Zorian, due to his somewhat colorful childhood, did. In fact, he could pick your average lock without using magic at all – it was just a lot slower than his little magic trick and required him to carry around a set of lockpicks.\r\n\r\nHe stopped in front of the door leading into the alchemical workshop and tried the handle. Like Zach said, it was locked. Shrugging, Zorian placed his palm over the keyhole and closed his eyes. He could feel Zach and Ibery cluster around him to get a better look at what he was doing, and did his best to block them out. He needed total concentration for this.\r\n\r\nHe had developed this particular trick back in his second year, after he got bored of refining the standard shaping exercises they were given. It involved flooding the locking mechanism with his mana, using the resulting mana field as a sort of ‘touch sight’ to get a feel for the lock, and then carefully moving the tumblers into proper position so he could neutralize the lock. It took him months of stubborn practice, but by now he was good enough at it to unlock most doors in 30 seconds or less.\r\n\r\nEven warded ones. He didn’t say this to Zach and Ibery, but the door he was trying to open was actually warded. Anything even remotely important in the academy was, including most of the doors. However, as Zorian quickly discovered when he experimented with the newly-developed skill, low-level wards were very specific – they countered a handful of common unlocking spells, and nothing else. Zorian’s little trick was not a structured spell, and thus didn’t trip these rudimentary wards at all.\r\n\r\nThe door clicked and Zorian tried the door handle again. This time the door opened without resistance.\r\n\r\n“Wow,” said Zach as they all filed into the workshop. “You can open a lock just by pressing your hand against it for a few seconds!”\r\n\r\nZorian gave him a sour look. “It’s a lot more complicated than that – that’s just the visible part.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t doubt that for a second,” Zach said.\r\n\r\nStill, while Zach seemed very impressed with Zorian’s achievement, Ibery remained strangely quiet and kept giving him funny looks. This was why he hated telling people about his lock-picking prowess – most immediately assumed he was some kind of a thief. Well, that and he didn’t want the academy authorities to find out about his achievement. They would no doubt change their warding scheme and then he wouldn’t be able to do what he just did.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Ibery wasn’t as condemning as some people Zorian met in his life, and got over her suspicions quickly once he started to prepare the salve. Strangely enough, Zach didn’t know how to make one, even though it was a fairly simple thing to make and Zach had demonstrated some mightily impressive alchemical work in class. He didn’t appear all that interested in learning, either – apparently the anti-rash salve was too mundane for his tastes, and he was only interested in things like strength potions and wound closing elixirs. That sounded like trying to build a house without bothering to set up proper foundations, but it wasn’t Zorian who was a decade old time traveler. Yet.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t those purple creeper leaves?” Ibery asked, pointing at the small pile Zorian had placed on a wet piece of cloth.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” confirmed Zorian, wrapping the leaves into the cloth. “They’re the main ingredient, though they have to be crushed first. Alchemical manuals usually claim you have to reduce the leaves into powder but it’s not really necessary to go that far. You just have to use more leaves otherwise, but it’s not like purple creepers are in short supply…”\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the salve was done and Zach was kind enough to conjure some kind of illusionary mirror so Ibery could apply the salve on herself right then and there. Kind and sneaky, because while Ibery was busy with applying the salve on herself, Zach dragged Zorian away in the corner so he could talk to him in private.\r\n\r\n“So?” Zorian prompted. “What is it?”\r\n\r\nZach reached into his pocket and pulled out a ring, which he promptly handed to Zorian. It was a featureless band of gold that reacted strangely when Zorian channeled some mana into it.\r\n\r\n“It’s a spell formula,” Zach said.\r\n\r\n“Magic missile?” guessed Zorian.\r\n\r\n“That, plus shield and flamethrower,” Zach said. “Now you can use all three in actual combat.”\r\n\r\nZorian looked at the ring with newfound respect. There was only so much one could cram into a spell formula, and it was mostly dependant on the size of the item used as a base. Turning something as small as a ring into a spell formula for three different spells was a pretty impressive feat, even if they were relatively low-level ones.\r\n\r\n“Must have been pretty expensive,” Zorian remarked.\r\n\r\n“Made it myself, actually,” Zach said with a grin.\r\n\r\n“Still, that’s a pretty valuable thing to give away to someone you’ve met less than a month ago,” said Zorian. “Why do I get the feeling I’ll be needing this in the near future?”\r\n\r\nZach’s smile disappeared and he suddenly became more subdued. “Maybe. I’m just making sure, you know. You never know when an angry troll might get a jump on you or something.”\r\n\r\n“How… oddly specific,” noted Zorian. “You know, you’ve been getting steadily more nervous as the summer festival approaches. And you seem oddly interested in making sure I attend the dance.”\r\n\r\n“You will, right?” Zach prompted.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I told you I will half a dozen times already,” huffed Zorian. “What’s so important about the dance, anyway? What’s going to happen there, oh great traveler from the future?”\r\n\r\n“You have to see it to believe it,” Zach sighed. “It’s possibly even more implausible than time travel being real.”\r\n\r\n“That bad?” asked Zorian, privately agreeing that an invasion of that scale was something he would have had trouble believing in if he had not lived through it.\r\n\r\n“Just… try to survive, okay?” Zach sighed. Before Zorian could say anything else, Zach suddenly donned a mask of fake cheerfulness and spoke in a voice loud enough to be heard by Ibery. “Wow, Zorian, I’m sure glad we’ve had this talk but I should really get going now! Have to be well rested for tomorrow! Bye, Zorian! Bye, Ibery! I’ll see you both at the dance!”\r\n\r\nAnd then he left. Zorian shook his head at the other boy’s exit and walked up to Ibery, who was now free of purple rash that once covered her face and neck.\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess we should go too,” Zorian said. “The academy normally doesn’t have anyone patrolling after dark, but that idiot’s shouting may have alerted someone to our presence.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Um, right.”\r\n\r\nZorian watched Ibery as they filed out of the workshop and he used his magic trick to re-lock the door again. She seemed strangely subdued for someone who got what they wanted.\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong?” he finally asked after a while.\r\n\r\n“Err, nothing’s wrong,” she said. “Why do you ask?”\r\n\r\n“You don’t seem very happy to be cured,” he noted.\r\n\r\n“I am!” she protested. “It’s just…”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” he prompted.\r\n\r\n“I don’t have anyone to go to the dance with,” she said. “The boy I was hoping to go with already has someone by now.”\r\n\r\nIf her unnamed boy was Fortov (probably, considering her obvious crush on him), then yes, he most certainly did. In fact, he probably had one weeks in advance, so there was never much chance of her going with him in the first place, but he didn’t feel the need to crush her dreams like that.\r\n\r\n“Then you’ll just have to do the same thing I will and go to the dance all by yourself, won’t you?” concluded Zorian.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly stopped and gave him an appraising glance.\r\n\r\n“You don’t have anyone to go with, either?” she asked.\r\n\r\nZorian closed his eyes and swore in his head. He really walked into this one, didn’t he?\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nZorian was nervous. Ever since his very first restart, he had been studiously avoiding the city on the day of the festival, not willing to get caught up in the invasion again. Being present within city limits could easily result in his grisly death, after all, and back then he wasn’t sure whether his current restart would be his last. That wasn’t an option anymore, unless he wanted to clue in Zach that there was something wrong with him (he didn’t).\r\n\r\nBottom line was, he was stuck attending the dance, with the unexpected addition of Ibery as his date for the evening. He wasn’t exactly happy with that, actually. He didn’t really have much of a plan for the evening, except to wait and see what would happen, but Ibery’s presence at his side would no doubt limit him. Not to mention that he still remembered his disastrous evening with Akoja, and had very little desire to live through a repeat performance, consequences-erasing time loop or not.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his evening with Akoja, Zorian had to admit one thing about Ibery: she was a lot more reasonable and considerate than Akoja was. She didn’t drag him out of his room 2 hours before the event, or make him wait smack in the middle of the huge throng of people gathered at the entrance, or drag him off to chat with a bunch of people who only cared about him being Daimen’s and Fortov’s brother… She was also more interested in scanning the crowd for any trace of Fortov than paying attention to him, but that was okay – he was under no illusion that she had asked him out because she was actually interested in him. After a while he decided to have mercy on her and informed her that Fortov was already inside, preparing for tonight’s performance along with the other members of the academy music club.\r\n\r\nNaturally, Zach’s entrance was in the boy’s usual flamboyant style. He had caught everyone’s attention when he had shown up with not one, but two dates for the evening (Zorian didn’t recognize either girl), and then further wooed people by demonstrating some very impressive – and attention-grabbing – dancing. Apparently Zach had learned more than magic during these restarts. Zorian clapped with the others when Zach finally finished showing off, and considered the merits of sinking some time into a non-magical skill. Not dancing, though. Or any other ‘high society’ skill, for that matter – honing those beyond the elementary level he had already grasped would require him to construct a mask so thorough he wasn’t sure he’d be able to take it off afterwards. The benefits weren’t worth selling his soul over, even metaphorically.\r\n\r\n“This is a lot fancier than I thought it would be,” Ibery noted, fingering the lacy tablecloth in front of her.\r\n\r\n“It’s obviously more than just a school dance,” agreed Zorian. “I’m guessing the Academy was organizing some kind of event for foreign dignitaries this year and then decided to simply merge it with the school dance for whatever reason.”\r\n\r\n“I guess,” Ibery said. “They did invest a lot into making everything look good this year, and I doubt they did it for our sake.” Ibery looked at the far end of the table, where Zach was entertaining a small crowd around him, his two escorts nowhere to be seen. After a few seconds of this observation she turned to Zorian and stared at him strangely.\r\n\r\n“What?” Zorian said, a little unnerved by her stare.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been meaning to ask you…” she began hesitantly. “What is it between you and Zach? I mean, I know you’re friends with him, but how did that come about? You seem very different from one another.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a recent thing,” said Zorian. “And it was mostly Zach’s doing, to be honest. All I did was escort him home after he got sick in class one day, and he decided we were best friends after that. I sort of went along with the flow.”\r\n\r\n“So you don’t know about… um…”\r\n\r\n“His sudden growth in skill?” guessed Zorian. He was actually surprised she hadn’t questioned him about that sooner. Almost everyone else did. Of course, she would get the same shameless lie that he fed to everyone who questioned him about it. “I have no idea how that happened, but I can tell you it’s real and not some kind of a trick like many people have been suggesting. He has been tutoring me in combat magic for a while now, and he really knows his stuff.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I heard you were doing that,” Ibery said, causing Zorian to frown. Being associated with Zach had made people disturbingly interested in his activities, no matter how mundane or irrelevant they may be. Having people scrutinize his every action like they had been doing for this past month was a novel experience. Novel and unwelcome. “Kyron has been kind of impressed with your growth, you know?”\r\n\r\nYeah… at least until he found out that Zach was involved, at which point it simply became one more thing that made Zach such a mystery, rather than a product of Zorian’s own talent. Obviously Zach had some kind of secret teaching technique on top of everything else. Obviously.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not like he was still bitter or anything!\r\n\r\n“Impressed, right,” said Zorian sourly. “So what do you think is behind Zach’s amazingness?”\r\n\r\n“Err, well… it’s kind of silly,” Ibery said.\r\n\r\nZorian gestured for her to go on. He always loved to hear the explanation people thought up to explain the mystery that was Zach. Much of the speculation wasn’t serious, so much as attempts to think up the most imaginative (or the funniest) solution to the problem, so he doubted Ibery’s explanation was any sillier than some of the stuff he had been hearing all month long. His personal favorite was that Zach performed an ancient ritual where you eat another person’s brain in order to get their knowledge.\r\n\r\n“Time dilation,” Ibery said after a brief moment of hesitation.\r\n\r\nZorian blinked. Oh Ibery… So close, and yet so far away…\r\n\r\n“I don’t think any hasting spell is that effective, to be honest,” said Zorian. “Zach isn’t just a little better than he was – I’d personally put him around 3rd circle at least. I actually don’t think he has any reason to attend the classes anymore, except that he finds it amusing to do so and flaunt his knowledge to everybody.”\r\n\r\n“I kind of noticed that,” Ibery said, glancing momentarily to the small group of people surrounding Zach. “But I wasn’t thinking of hasting magic. Do you know what the Black Rooms are?” Zorian shook his head in negative. “There are rumors that powerful nations like ours have special training facilities that use extreme levels of time dilation. You go inside the facility, spend a couple of months, or even years inside, and when you get out only a day or two have passed outside.”\r\n\r\nZorian’s eyebrows rose at the description. If one of the major powers had something like that, why weren’t the effects more keenly felt? None of the Successor States were shy about using their power, and would have surely used such a tool to churn out trained mages on a mass scale by now.\r\n\r\n“It’s just a rumor,” Ibery quickly added. “Something between a conspiracy theory and an urban legend. I only know about it because one of my friends loves those kinds of things and she keeps insisting there is one such facility in the tunnels beneath the city. Supposedly they consume massive amounts of mana, so they must be located at mana wells.”\r\n\r\n“And the Hole is the biggest mana well there is,” Zorian noted. “What’s the explanation for such secrecy surrounding them? You’d think they’d be using it pretty intensively.”\r\n\r\n“They can’t,” Ibery said. “Or at least that’s how the story goes. They have some kind of severe limitations on their use. Exactly how countries pick who gets to use the Black Rooms is where the ‘conspiracy theory’ part comes in. The more conventional theories suggest they’re simply fancy facilities for training Black Ops super-agents. The wilder ones are… well, wild.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a neat theory,” Zorian hummed speculatively. Far closer to reality than anything else he’d heard, though he’d never say that aloud, even as a joke. If she could take such a farfetched rumor seriously, there was a good chance she might actually believe him upon hearing the truth, and that would be very awkward at the moment. Maybe he should try to convince her in one of the next restarts? Something to think about, at least. “But if Zach had spent years in one of those Black Rooms, why hasn’t he visibly aged? And why exactly would they let Zach use one of those?”\r\n\r\n“Well, he didn’t have to literally spend years,” Ibery said. “It’s not that anything he’s done is that advanced. A couple of months of intense tutoring could probably produce the effects we’re looking at. And even if he spent years, there are potions that can halt your aging for a year or two. They actually work better on young people.”\r\n\r\nZorian resisted the urge to frown as he realized something. As much as Zach liked to show off, he never really went wild with his abilities for all to see. If Zach had showed the sort of magic he did during the invasion, neither Ibery nor anyone else would be dismissing Zach’s prowess as ‘not advanced’ so easily. Then again, perhaps that was the whole point. Extremely skilled Zach was surprising, maybe even shocking to those who knew him before the change. Instant archmage Zach would be probably alarming in the extreme and inspire a matching attitude in people around him.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Zach’s behavior was a lot more calculated than he thought it was?\r\n\r\n“As for why him?” Ibery continued. “Well, he’s a Noveda. They were quite influential before their eventual fall, and I don’t just mean in the sense of being rich. They had their fingers everywhere. I could easily see some of that old influence surviving to this very day. Zach is the last of his line, and the fate of his House rests upon his shoulders. Perhaps this was simply a desperate maneuver by Zach’s guardians, trying to turn Zach into a worthy successor capable of returning Noveda to their former glory.”\r\n\r\nThe ground shook, followed by a deafening explosion less than a second later. Windows rattled, but didn’t break. An uneasy silence descended upon the dance hall, only broken by the periodic rumble of more distant explosions.\r\n\r\n“What… what was that?” Ibery asked fearfully.\r\n\r\nShe wasn’t the only one asking that kind of questions. Agitated murmurs started traveling through the gathered crowd, steadily growing in volume and alarm. The ever-present pressure Zorian always felt from being inside crowds intensified and… changed. What was usually just an annoyance pushing on the edges of his consciousness suddenly became a suffocating blanket of fear. He struggled not to faint as foreign feelings invaded his mind. What the hell was happening to him? He didn’t remember anything about an attack like this from his previous experience of the invasion.\r\n\r\nA minute ticked away. Then ten. Zorian could practically feel the anxiety and agitation of the crowd steadily rising. The last (and first) time he had lived through the invasion he was standing on the roof when that first barrage descended to earth, and was momentarily incapacitated as a result. At least, that’s what he had thought. Apparently he had been knocked out for quite a bit longer than he realized, because by his reckoning Ilsa and Kyron should have been rushing to the roof to see what was happening by now. He could see them arguing about something in a nearby corner, and neither made the slightest move towards the roof.\r\n\r\n“Zorian?” Ibery tried for either the fifth or sixth time, Zorian wasn’t sure. “Are you sure you’re alright? Maybe I should go find someone-“\r\n\r\n“I’m fine,” Zorian said, somehow managing to shove the oppressive feelings aside for the moment. The explosions had finally stopped but that hadn’t led to people calming down. If anything, now that the situation had calmed down somewhat, they wanted answers, and they wanted them now. They were getting restless. Thankfully, the academy staff seemed to realize this as well. “Look, Ilsa is trying to say something.”\r\n\r\n“Please remain calm!” Ilsa said from the music stage, using the same magic that carried music evenly across the dance hall to make herself heard by everyone present. “Me and my colleague will go to the roof now and open communications with the city authorities to find out what is going on. Please don’t go anywhere until we return.”\r\n\r\nWell… that didn’t do much to calm people down. If anything, they got even more unruly than they were before Ilsa’s speech, and some outright ignored her warnings and left the dance hall the moment she went up the stairs and out of sight. He couldn’t judge them too harshly, since in another timeline he had done the exact same thing. On the positive side, the oppressive feeling lifted and reverted back to the familiar headache-inducing pressure. He breathed a giant sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Zorian,” greeted Zach, approaching Zorian. Of course he’d come to talk to him now… “Quite a commotion, huh? And I see you talked miss Ambercomb into being your date for the evening! Congratulations! I never knew you liked older girls.”\r\n\r\n“I’m only a year older than him,” Ibery protested. She glanced briefly at Zorian to see if he would point out that it was her who asked him out, and relaxed when she realized he wouldn’t. Zorian had to restrain himself from rolling his eyes. “And how come you’re here all by yourself? Why don’t you introduce us to your dates?”\r\n\r\nIf Ibery thought to fluster Zach by pointing out the plural nature of his partners for the evening, she was going to be sorely disappointed. And indeed, Zach only smiled at her, completely unaffected by the jab.\r\n\r\n“They decided to leave for home early,” Zach shrugged. “Probably for the best, considering what happened.”\r\n\r\n“What did happen, though?” asked Zorian. He didn’t expect to get a straight answer out of Zach, of course, but it was worth a try.\r\n\r\n“I guess we’ll find out soon,” said Zach, pointing to the bottom of the stairs leading to the roof, where Ilsa was talking to a bunch of students. After a couple of seconds Zorian realized that Akoja was among them, and recognized several other faces as well.\r\n\r\n“Who is she talking to?” asked Ibery.\r\n\r\n“Class representatives, I think,” Zorian said. “At least, the ones I recognize are all class representatives for their groups.”\r\n\r\nIt was so frustratingly slow. Maybe Zorian was expecting a little too much from a mere educational institution, but their response to the invasion was pretty underwhelming. At the very least he had expected them to start evacuating people to the shelters by now, or organize some kind of a defense force, or… well, anything, really. He was getting an impression that Ilsa and Kyron didn’t even realize the severity of the situation yet.\r\n\r\nFinally, Ilsa seemed to finish with her instructions and the crowd of class representatives dispersed into the crowd. It only took Zorian a minute to realize what they were doing – each one was gathering their own classmates into a single group. He bid Ibery goodbye and left towards his own group together with Zach.\r\n\r\nOnce everyone was present, Akoja told them what the plan was. The academy was going to use their limited teleportation capabilities to get foreign dignitaries and other important people out of the city, and the students were going to descend into the tunnels beneath the city to reach the shelters on foot - with no teachers present to guide and defend them, because they had other duties currently and class representatives had to know the evacuation routes to get the job anyway.\r\n\r\nZorian looked at Zach to gauge his reaction and saw that the boy’s expression was grim and focused.\r\n\r\n“All right,” Zach mumbled. “Show time.”\r\n\r\nZorian had a bad feeling about this.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, it wasn’t Zach who raised the alarm – it was Raynie, of all people. How exactly she detected the winter wolves 5 minutes before they showed up he had no idea, but notice them she did and she immediately raised the alarm. A lot of students didn’t believe her, but most weren’t willing to risk it. The entire procession of students started to move faster towards the small cylindrical building that marked the staircase leading down into the shelters.\r\n\r\nThey never made it there before the winter wolves reached them.\r\n\r\nZorian wasn’t a soldier, and would never call himself an expert on tactics, but what the throng of students did upon sighting the horde of winter wolves coming after them still struck him as monumentally stupid. They scattered. The ones closest to the dungeon entrance rushed towards it, but the others immediately sought the closest shelter. He could hear Zach’s frantic shouting, telling people not to separate from the main group but it was in vain.\r\n\r\nCursing, Zorian snatched Akoja by the wrist before she could bolt towards the nearby apartment building and wordlessly pointed towards the dungeon entrance. For a moment he thought about explaining his reasoning in more detail, but he knew he didn’t have enough time for that. He let go of her and started running, hoping she would have the presence of mind to follow.\r\n\r\nThankfully, she did follow him, as did several other students that witnessed the silent exchange and realized the importance of it. As they ran, more people joined them, seeking safety in numbers.\r\n\r\nAround him, chaos reigned. The winter wolves were pouring in by the hundreds, and unlike the fleeing students they were frighteningly well coordinated. Small groups of 3 to 4 wolves detached themselves periodically from the main body to intercept lone targets before rejoining the horde, using their superior numbers to flank and outmaneuver their opponents. Their white fur and the surprising silence with which they moved made them seem like an army of ghosts risen from the underworld to punish the living. Screams. Shouting. Flashes of light and canine howls of pain too – not every student was helpless. Up ahead Zach was defending the entrance to the tunnels viciously, sending swarm after swarm of force projectiles that hit far harder than your run of the mill magic missile, felling scores of winter wolves with each volley. A number of people reached the safety of a nearby building and promptly barricaded themselves inside, ignoring the pleas of those outside to let them in.\r\n\r\nJust as Zorian thought they would make it to the entrance without incident, his luck ran out. A large group of 30 or so winter wolves noticed them and moved to intercept. The group halted immediately, unsure what to do as the pack continued to get closer. They had to go through it to reach the shelters, but fighting the wolves was suicide. Zach was busy incinerating a group of war trolls that finally made their appearance and wouldn’t be able to help for a while.\r\n\r\n“I told you I should have brought my sword,” one of the boys groused. “But noooo, it’s not suitable for a school dance you said. You’re too paranoid for your own good, you said.”\r\n\r\n“Oh shut up,” a female voice snapped back.\r\n\r\nZorian resisted the urge to fire off a couple of missiles at the approaching winter wolves. Even shaped as piercers, they weren’t guaranteed to kill in one shot something as resilient as a winter wolf, and he still tended to fail quite often when he tried to weave a homing function in them, so there was no guarantee he would even hit anything. He had to use his mana intelligently.\r\n\r\nNot everyone thought so, however. A number of people had a spell formula hidden on them in the form of a ring or a necklace, much like he did, and they threw missile after magic missile into the advancing wolves. Only one girl was capable of casting a proper homing bolt, so most of them missed, and when they did hit they were just smashers so they didn’t kill any of them. They did, however, slow the pack down and force it to cluster together, since the girl that could fire homing bolts targeted any wolf that tried to detach from the pack to flank them. And that gave him an idea.\r\n\r\nThe moment the pack got close enough, Zorian fired an overpowered flamethrower straight into their front lines. Clustered together as they were, most of them were caught in the blast. The winter wolves, notoriously weak to fire, howled in fear and agony. That’s when someone else fired another flamethrower into their ranks, this one much bigger and hotter than Zorian’s, and the winter wolves promptly turned and fled. The ones that still lived, that is.\r\n\r\nZorian turned to see who cast the other flamethrower and was surprised to see Briam there, staring smugly at the charred corpses in front of him. He was holding his fire drake in his arms like a living weapon, and the little lizard was licking its chops like it wanted to eat its kills.\r\n\r\nSo much for his theory that the drake was too young to breathe fire.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of shock at the sudden reversal, they all scrambled into the building housing the dungeon entrance and immediately descended into the tunnels below. Zorian was immediately intercepted by a worried Ibery, who seemed extremely relieved that he was alive. Even though he knew her death wouldn’t be permanent, he had to admit he was glad she survived as well.\r\n\r\nThough, now that he could sit down and think about it a little, it wasn’t that unusual she had survived. She was a fourth year student, and they were at the front of the procession for some reason. That was very unfortunate, because fourth year students were, presumably, much more capable of defending themselves than third year ones… and they were the ones who reached the safety of the shelters first, leaving their younger compatriots to fend for themselves.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know you had any fire spells,” Briam noted from his left, stroking his familiar affectionately. “I guess that’s one of the things Zach has been teaching you this past month, huh?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Zorian admitted. He gave the fire lizard a dubious look, and the reptile stared back at him challengingly. “Did you really bring your familiar to the school dance?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no way,” Briam laughed. “I’m not that attached to him. No, I used a recall spell to summon him to my side when the winter wolves started pouring in.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t summoning pretty mana intensive, though?” Zorian asked.\r\n\r\n“Not if you’re summoning your familiar,” Briam said. “We’re bound together, he and I. Connected through the soul. It’s a lot easier and a lot less taxing to cast certain spells where they concern him.”\r\n\r\n“Huh,” Zorian hummed.\r\n\r\nAn hour went by, with little to show for it. Zorian listened to stories of people around him, trying to put some sense into what had transpired and thinking what he could change in the next restart to make this evacuation thing less of a fiasco. His thoughts were interrupted when a group of teachers finally stumbled into the shelters.\r\n\r\nThere were six of them and they looked tired and frightened, much like the students who had gathered around them for explanations and assurances. The only one among them that inspired confidence in Zorian was Kyron, who remained as stoic as always. He was no longer bare-chested, opting to wear full body armor that sort of resembled the chitinous shell of a saint bug, and had a plethora of spell rods hanging off his belt in addition to the combat staff he was firmly gripping in one hand.\r\n\r\nKyron had bad news – the attack on the academy was just one piece in an all-out invasion targeting the entire city. Zorian already knew this, of course, but everyone else was suitably shocked. The invasion was well prepared, and most of the defenders had been overpowered right at the start. The city was about to fall. Once that happened, the shelters would become just a giant death trap. They would have to go outside and fight their way out of the city before the invaders could secure everything of critical importance and turn their attention to them.\r\n\r\nPeople were taking it pretty badly.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you just teleport us out!?” someone called. “You’re supposed to be able to do that!”\r\n\r\n“Academy ward control has been subverted,” Kyron said calmly. “The invaders have turned our own teleportation wards against us. We can’t teleport in or out.”\r\n\r\nZorian groaned. The enemy had control of the wards? How on earth did they do that? The academy wasn’t just some random house with a generic warding scheme – it’s supposed to be too secure and sophisticated for that!\r\n\r\nThe questions continued for a minute or so before Kyron got enough of it and started to bark out orders. They needed to get moving.\r\n\r\nZorian was paying attention to something else though. The student next to him had been acting strangely ever since Kyron and his cohort entered the shelters. Zorian could practically feel the boy’s eagerness and anticipation. For what, he couldn’t say, but he had a feeling it was nothing good.\r\n\r\nThat is why, when the boy threw a vial full of sickly green liquid on the floor and smashed it with his foot, Zorian held his breath and fired a smasher straight into the boy’s chest. Foul smelling green smoke erupted from the broken vial, and the shelters erupted into chaos.\r\n\r\nZorian couldn’t see anything through the no doubt poisonous smoke, but the sounds of fighting were unmistakable. He stumbled through the smoke, trying to find an end to it and failing. He could tell from the hacking students around him that breathing in would be a bad idea. Thank god it didn’t also irritate the eyes or he’d never be able to cast a shield in time to stop a magic missile from smashing into his face. A circular plane of force flickered into existence in front of him, soaking the hit. The shield wavered for a second but held.\r\n\r\nAnd then Zorian heard Kyron shout a series of words, and all the smoke around him rushed towards the source of Kyron’s voice, as if caught in some sort of vacuum. Zorian had just enough time to see Kyron holding his left hand in the air, a smoky green ball compacting itself above it, before he was forced to erect a shield again.\r\n\r\nAt least he could breathe now. Thank the gods for small favors.\r\n\r\nBefore the attackers – who had probably teleported in under the cover of smoke, because Zorian would remember a bunch of middle-aged men in brown robes if they had been present when he got into the shelters – could regain initiative, Kyron snapped one of his hands and a shining whip flashed through the air. The invaders promptly fell apart, the upper half of their bodies sliding off the lower half like they were never attached to one another at all.\r\n\r\nZorian stared at Kyron in shock. He knew the retired battle-mage was capable, but seeing it was something else. The man had assessed the situation within moments and solved it with a total of two spells. He wondered what would have happened during the initial evacuation if Kyron had been leading the students. He couldn’t help but think that Kyron would have found a way to repel the initial winter wolf rush without losing anyone. Certainly the students would be more inclined to listen to Kyron than their class representatives – the man had a certain aura of command around him.\r\n\r\n“How… the hell… are you… still standing?” wheezed Zach not far from him. Apparently he had breathed in some of the smoke, and was affected just like everyone else. Even decades old time travelers could be brought down by some tricks, it seemed.\r\n\r\nZorian was about to answer when the ground exploded next to him, showering him with stone fragments and knocking him on his back. He heard Kyron chanting something, but it was too late for him – the giant brown worm that emerged from the ground was far faster than it should have been and Zorian was in too much pain to move. He saw a huge toothy maw closing around him, and then he knew only blackness.\r\n\r\nHis last thoughts were that it wasn’t fair. Just how many contingencies did these people have? These invaders were freaking cheaters!');
INSERT INTO `capitulo` (`Chapter_ID`, `Book ID`, `Chapter Num`, `Texto`) VALUES
('Concentrate and Try Again', 'Mother of Learning', 6, 'Zorian stared at the endless fields blurring past him, the silence of the otherwise empty compartment only broken by the rhythmic thumping of the train’s machinery. He looked calm and relaxed, but it was only a practiced façade and nothing more.\r\n\r\nHis mask of stoicism might have seemed silly, as there was no one around to judge him, but over the years Zorian had found that acting calm on the outside helped him achieve calm more easily on the inside as well. He needed any help he could get in achieving inner peace now, because he was about to start panicking like a headless chicken.\r\n\r\nWhy was this happening again? The first time it had happened, he was dead sure the lich was responsible. The spell had hit him, and then he woke up in the past. Cause and effect. He hadn’t been hit by some mysterious spell this time, though – not unless someone had snuck into the train compartment while he was sleeping, which he found very unlikely. No, he had just dozed off and woke up in the past again, as if it was the most normal thing in the world.\r\n\r\nThen again, it did highlight some things that had been bothering him until now. After all, why had the lich cast a time travel spell on him? It seemed rather counterproductive to the whole ‘secret invasion’ plot. Time travel seemed too purposeful and complex to be an accidental side effect, and he seriously doubted the lich had used a spell whose effects it did not understand. Even a neophyte like him knew what a horrible idea it was to use a spell you don’t understand in an uncontrolled environment, and the undead spellcaster wouldn’t have reached the level it did if it was willing to do something so foolish for the sake of a couple of brats it had already defeated anyway. No, there was a simpler explanation: the lich wasn’t responsible for his time traveling problems. It really had been trying to kill them. ‘Them’, plural, because Zach had also been the target. The same Zach that had been shockingly good in all his classes all of a sudden. The same Zach that was wandering around the city armed to the teeth with combat magic that should be beyond any academy student. The same Zach that had been making very curious offhand comments all month long…\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was Zach, not the lich, who had cast the time travel spell?\r\n\r\nZach being a time traveler would explain his vast abilities and inexplicable academic improvement quite nicely. Since this particular method of time travel seems to just send a person’s mind into their younger body, he could be of an arbitrarily large age, and what Zorian remembered of Zach’s various comments led him to believe the boy had lived through this particular time period many times over. A mage with decades of experience and detailed foreknowledge would no doubt find 3rd year curriculum laughably easy.\r\n\r\nThough even if Zach had been the one to cast the time travel spell, there was still left the question of why Zorian was thrown back too. It could have easily been an accident – he knew that grabbing a mage while they’re in the process of casting a teleport spell could pull you along for the ride, and they were basically tangled with one another – but that didn’t explain why Zorian was repeating this month for the second time. Zach had been absent all month long, and thus hadn’t had the opportunity to cast anything at Zorian.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t know what to think. Hopefully Zach would be present for questioning this time around.\r\n\r\n“Now stopping in Korsa,” a disembodied voice echoed, the faulty speakers crackling with signal noise every once in a while. “I repeat, now stopping in Korsa. Thank you.”\r\n\r\nWhat, already? A glance through the window revealed the familiar white tablet confirming his arrival at the trading hub. He was half-tempted to get off the train and spend the entire month fooling around and trying to forget this whole time travel business, but quickly dismissed it. Blowing off the beginning of the school year like that would be really irresponsible and self-destructive, even if going through another identical month of classes was anything but appealing. There was a possibility that he would be flung back into the past for the third time, of course, but that wasn’t something he should be relying on. There was no way the spell could keep sending him back indefinitely, after all – it was bound to run out of mana sooner or later. Probably sooner, since time travel must be pretty high level.\r\n\r\n…right?\r\n\r\n“Um…”\r\n\r\nZorian snapped out of his thoughts and finally noticed the boy peering into his compartment. He frowned. He specifically chose this compartment because it was completely empty during his… second attempt at life. After he had left the green turtleneck girl to her giggling fate, he had come here for some peace, so this time he decided to be proactive and went here right from the start. Apparently it wasn’t that simple. He supposed that his very presence attracted the boy – some people just plain liked company, and would avoid empty compartments.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” Zorian said politely, hoping the boy just wanted to ask him something instead of trying to find a seat.\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken.\r\n\r\n“Do you mind if I sit here?”\r\n\r\n“No, go right ahead,” said Zorian, giving the boy a forced smile. Damn.\r\n\r\nThe boy smiled brightly at him, and quickly dragged his luggage in. A lot of luggage.\r\n\r\n“First year, right?” Zorian asked, unable to help himself. So much for his plan on remaining silent and creeping the boy out into leaving the compartment. Oh well.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” the boy agreed. “How did you know?”\r\n\r\n“Your luggage,” Zorian remarked. “You do realize the academy grounds are pretty far from the main station? Your arms are going to fall off by the time you get there.”\r\n\r\nThe boy blinked. Apparently he didn’t know. “Um, it’s really not that bad, right?”\r\n\r\nZorian shrugged. “You better hope it doesn’t rain.”\r\n\r\n“Ha ha,” the boy laughed nervously. “I’m sure I’m not that unlucky.”\r\n\r\nZorian smirked. Ah, the benefits of foresight. Or was it hindsight? Language really wasn’t designed with the possibility of time-travel in mind.\r\n\r\n“Ah! I didn’t introduce myself!” The boy suddenly blurted out. “I’m Byrn Ivarin.”\r\n\r\n“Zorian Kazinski.”\r\n\r\nThe boy’s eyes lit up immediately. “Like-“\r\n\r\n“Like Daimen Kazinski, yes,” Zorian said, suddenly finding the window incredibly interesting.\r\n\r\nThe boy stared at him expectantly, but if he had expected further elaboration from Zorian on the subject, he was about to be sorely disappointed. The last thing Zorian wanted to do was talk about his eldest brother.\r\n\r\n“So, um, are you related to Daimen Kazinski or is your last name just a coincidence?” asked the boy after a lengthy pause.\r\n\r\nZorian pretended he couldn’t hear him, and instead retrieved his notebook from the neighboring seat and studied it intently. It was almost completely empty, since all his previous notes about the invasion and the mystery of his ‘future memories’ were now gone, lost in a future he left behind him. It wasn’t much of a loss, since the vast majority of those notes had been worthless – hollow speculations and dead-end leads that hadn’t got him any closer to solving this mystery. Still, he had written down a few things he remembered from his previous notes, like the spell chant the lich had uttered before killing him. Yes, Zach was likely responsible for all of this, but he couldn’t be sure…\r\n\r\nAfter judging the silence to have lasted for a fittingly awkward amount of time, Zorian looked up from his notebook to fixate a look of confusion at the waiting boy.\r\n\r\n“Huh? Did you say something?” Zorian pretended, frowning slightly as if he honestly hadn’t heard a word of the question he was asked.\r\n\r\n“Err, never mind,” the boy backpedaled. “It’s not important.”\r\n\r\nZorian gave the boy a genuine smile. At least he could take a hint.\r\n\r\nHe talked to the boy for a while, mostly just answering the boy’s questions about first year curriculum, before growing bored with it and starting to feign interest in his notebook again, hoping he will take the hint.\r\n\r\n“What’s so interesting about that notebook, anyway?” He asked, either oblivious to Zorian’s disinterest in continued conversation or deliberately ignoring it. “Don’t tell me you’re studying already?”\r\n\r\n“No, these are just notes on some personal research,” said Zorian. “It’s not going too well so I’m a little frustrated with it. My mind keeps drifting to it.” Especially when the alternative was talking to an overly inquisitive first year.\r\n\r\n“The academy library-“\r\n\r\n“First thing I tried,” Zorian sighed. “I’m not stupid, you know?”\r\n\r\nThe boy rolled his eyes at him. “Did you search for the books yourself or did you ask the librarian to help you? Mother works as a librarian, and they have these special divination spells that let them find things in minutes that would take you decades if you search by title and skimming alone.”\r\n\r\nZorian opened his mouth before closing it. Ask the librarian for help, huh? Okay, maybe he is stupid.\r\n\r\n“Well… it’s not really a topic I want to bother the librarian with,” Zorian tried. Which was true, but he knew he’d end up trying it anyway. “Maybe I could find the spells themselves in the spell repository? But no, if they are anything like other divination spells it’s using them correctly and interpreting the results that’s the problem, not casting them…”\r\n\r\n“You could always get a job in the library,” the boy offered. “If the academy library is anything like the one my mother works in, they’re always desperate for help. They teach their employees how to use those spells as a matter of course.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” Zorian asked, rather intrigued by the idea.\r\n\r\n“It’s worth a try,” he said, shrugging.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the ride, Zorian stopped trying to evade conversation. Byrn had definitely earned some respect from him.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\n“Of course! We’re always looking for help!”\r\n\r\nWell… that was easy.\r\n\r\n“We can’t pay you much, understand – that miserable gnome of a headmaster cut our budget again! – but we’re very flexible about work time and we’ve got a pretty friendly atmosphere here…”\r\n\r\nZorian waited patiently for the librarian to run out of steam. She was an unassuming middle aged woman at first glance, but the moment she had begun speaking he realized her looks were rather deceiving – she was cheerful and had a sort of indescribable energy about her. Just standing around her made Zorian feel the same sort of pressure he felt when stuck in a crowd of people, and he had to rein in his instinct to step back as if from a raging fire.\r\n\r\n“I’m guessing you don’t get many work offers, then?” Zorian tried. “Why is that? Shouldn’t people be fighting tooth and nail to work in a place like this? It’s a pretty famous library.”\r\n\r\nShe snorted, and Zorian could swear he could feel the derision and a touch of bitterness in the seemingly innocuous sound. “Academy regulations require us to only hire employees that are first circle mages or higher. Most graduates have better paying and more glamorous options than this,” she waved her hand towards rows or bookshelves around them, “reducing us to hiring students. Who are…”\r\n\r\nShe suddenly stopped and blinked, as if remembering something. “But anyway, enough of that!” she said, clapping her hands and beaming at him. “From this day on, you’re one of the library assistants. Congratulations! If you have any questions, I’ll be glad to answer them.”\r\n\r\nIt was only through superhuman willpower that Zorian stopped himself from rolling his eyes at her. He never agreed to anything, merely inquired about the possibility of employment… and she undoubtedly knew that. But oh well, he did want the job, and not just because he was hoping to learn some nifty new spells and translate the lich’s chant – he suspected that library employees got to access parts of the library that would normally be restricted to him as a first circle mage, and that was just too much of a temptation to pass up.\r\n\r\n“Question one,” said Zorian, “How often do I come to work?”\r\n\r\nShe blinked, surprised for a moment. No doubt she expected him to protest her presumptuousness. “Well… when can you come? Between the classes, and the need for study time and other commitments, most of our student employees work once or twice a week. How much time can you set aside for this?”\r\n\r\n“The classes are pretty easy at this point,” Zorian said. “We’re mostly doing the review of our second year, which I know like the back of my hand. Setting aside one day for unexpected developments, I could be here 4 times a week. My weekends are mostly free too, if you need any help then.”\r\n\r\nZorian mentally berated himself for talking like that – the classes hadn’t even started yet, so how would he know what they consisted of? Luckily, the librarian didn’t call him out on it. Instead her eyes immediately lit up upon hearing this and she started shouting.\r\n\r\n“Ibery!” she called out. “I’ve got a new partner for you!”\r\n\r\nA bespectacled girl carrying an armload of books popped out of the small room adjacent to the information desk to see what was going on. Oh. It was the green turtleneck girl (she was wearing it even now) that he shared a compartment with…\r\n\r\n…except he had chosen a seat on the other side of the train this time, so they never met on the train. Oh well, probably wouldn’t have mattered anyway.\r\n\r\n“Anyway, I believe some introductions are in order,” the librarian said. “I am Kirithishli Korisova, one of the few actual librarians in this place. This pretty lady,” she gestured towards the turtleneck girl, who blushed at the praise and shifted uncomfortably, clutching the stack of books tighter in her arms, “is our resident busy little bee, Ibery Ambercomb. Ibery has been working here since last year, and I don’t know what I’d do without her. Ibery, this is Zorian Kazinski.”\r\n\r\nThe girl suddenly perked up at this. “Kazinski? As in…”\r\n\r\n“As in, younger brother of Daimen Kazinski,” Zorian said, unable to suppress a small sigh.\r\n\r\n“Um…”\r\n\r\n“Actually, I’m pretty sure she meant your other brother,” Kirithishli said with a sly smile. “She’s in class with Fortov and has a bit of a crush…”\r\n\r\nShe and a dozen other girls. Fortov never had a shortage of women throwing themselves at him.\r\n\r\n“Miss Korisova!” Ibery protested.\r\n\r\n“Oh, lighten up,” Kirithishli said. “Anyway, Zorian here will be working with us pretty heavily for the foreseeable future. Go show him what to do.”\r\n\r\nAnd just like that, he was employed at the library. Only time would tell if he was wasting his time.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nMuch like the last time, Zach hadn’t come to class. Zorian was half-expecting it, but it was no less annoying because of it. It cemented Zorian’s suspicion that Zach was heavily involved in this mess, but the boy’s absence made it impossible for Zorian to confront him about it. What was he supposed to do now?\r\n\r\nFor that matter, was he supposed to do anything at all? Last time he had been operating on the belief that if he didn’t do something about the invasion, no one would. No one else had the strange future memories he did, after all. If his speculations were correct, though, Zach had probably traveled through time specifically to stop the invasion – what other reason did he have to frequent this particular time period? Besides, he had been wandering the city during the attack, picking off attackers. So all in all, there just might be an experienced time-traveling mage on the job already, and he would only get in the way.\r\n\r\nThe problem with that idea was that he was ultimately just guessing, and had no idea if it was true or not. He could be dooming himself and the city through inaction, relying on a boy who, quite frankly, didn’t inspire too much confidence in him. Zach reminded him of his brothers a little too much. And besides, didn’t Zach lose against the lich? Yeah.\r\n\r\nNot knowing how to unravel the mystery presented to him, or even where to start, Zorian had thrown himself into schoolwork and his job at the library. Of course, thanks to going through this for the third time, the only issue he had with schoolwork was Xvim’s grating insistence that his grasp on the pen-spinning (as Zorian affectionately called it) exercise was abominable and that he had to do it over and over and over again. His time at the library, on the other hand, was… interesting, though not really in the way he hoped it would be.\r\n\r\nHe hadn’t learned any spells yet, though he suspected this was because there were so many other, more pressing things he had to learn before Kirithishli and Ibery decided to invest that kind of effort in him. Simply put, he wasn’t very good at his job. The seemingly simple job of shuffling some books around was made immensely more complicated by the various library protocols and the all-important book classification scheme. Zorian had hoped to demonstrate basic proficiency with his duties before asking for favors, but it had been two weeks and he was beginning to understand that it would take him at least a couple of months to reach that level, and he didn’t have that. The summer festival was getting closer.\r\n\r\nThat’s why he proceeded to corner Kirithishli after she had dismissed him for the day to ask her about the coveted book divinations. Ibery lingered, pretending to be busy so she could eavesdrop. She sure was nosy for such a shy girl.\r\n\r\n“Say, I’ve been meaning to ask a small favor of you,” Zorian began.\r\n\r\n“Go ahead,” Kirithishli said. “You’ve helped us a lot, so I’ll be happy to help if I can. It’s not often we get such a competent worker.”\r\n\r\n“Eh!?” balked Zorian. “Competent? I barely know what I’m doing – if it weren’t for your and Ibery’s help I would wander around like a headless chicken.”\r\n\r\n“That’s why I paired you with Ibery – to learn. And boy are you learning fast! Faster than I did when I first started at this job, that’s for sure. To be honest I usually give only the simplest and most tedious jobs to student employees, but since you’re more dedicated than them I’ve given you the advanced course.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” Zorian said after a short silence. “I’m flattered.” And he really was. “Anyway, I was wondering about book-finding divinations. I’ve been searching for a pretty obscure topic and I’m not going anywhere with it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Kirithishli said, slapping her forehead. “How could I forget about that!? Of course I’ll teach you, we teach all our long-term workers those. They’re a bit tricky to use, though, so it will take a while to learn how to use them properly. Ibery will show you how. Though you can always tell me what exactly you’re looking for and I’ll do my best to help you out. I know this library like the back of my hand, you know?”\r\n\r\nZorian debated the merit of showing her the lich’s chant, since he suspected it was something that could get him into a lot of trouble just for asking about it, but saw no other way. No doubt learning how to use those divinations took months – months he didn’t have. He took out his notebook and ripped out the corresponding page, handing it to her.\r\n\r\nKirithishli arched her eyebrow at the text, and Ibery gave up on all pretenses of not paying attention and peered over her shoulder to see what was on the slip of paper.\r\n\r\n“It’s an unknown language,” Zorian clarified. “I don’t even know which one, really.”\r\n\r\n“Hm, tricky,” Kirithishli remarked. “Finding a written reference based on a phonetic pronunciation of a word you don’t even understand is a tall order, even with divinations. You should just find an expert in languages to help you if it’s so important.”\r\n\r\n“You should try Zenomir,” piped in Ibery.\r\n\r\n“Our history teacher?” asked Zorian incredulously.\r\n\r\n“He also teaches linguistics,” Ibery said. “He’s a polyglot. Speaks 37 languages.”\r\n\r\n“Woah.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Ibery agreed. “He should at least know what language that is, even if he can’t read it. He’s pretty helpful if you approach him nicely, I doubt he’ll turn you away.”\r\n\r\nInteresting.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\n“Ah, mister Kazinski, what can I do for you?”\r\n\r\nZenomir Olgai was old. Really old. He wore blue robes – actual robes, like the magi of old – and had a carefully sculpted white beard. Despite his advanced age, he moved with a spring in his step and his eyes had sharpness that most people half his age lacked. Zorian hadn’t taken the linguistics elective, but he knew from his history class that Zenomir cared about his subject almost as much as Nora Boole did about runes and mathematics – though he at least understood that most students didn’t share his passion for the subject.\r\n\r\n“I was told you can help me with some translation,” Zorian said. “I have a pretty fragmentary recording of an unknown language in phonetic form, and I was hoping you could at least tell me what kind of language it is. It’s nothing like any language I’ve encountered so far.”\r\n\r\nZenomir perked up at the notion of an unknown language and gingerly took the paper slip with the lich’s chant from Zorian’s hand. His eyes widened barely a second afterward.\r\n\r\n“Where did you get this?” he asked quietly.\r\n\r\nZorian debated internally what to do and then settled for a measure of truth.\r\n\r\n“I was attacked by someone a while ago. They used a spell with that chant as the incantation. I just wanted to know what it does.”\r\n\r\nZenomir took a deep breath and leaned back. “You’re lucky it didn’t hit. It’s some kind of soul magic spell.”\r\n\r\n“Soul magic?”\r\n\r\n“Necromancy,” clarified Zenomir.\r\n\r\nZorian blinked. Necromancy? Well, it sort of made sense for the lich to use that sort of spells, but what did necromancy have to do with time travel? Nothing. This was pretty much a definite confirmation of Zach as a primary cause of his predicament.\r\n\r\n“So, wait, what is that language anyway?” asked Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Hm? Oh! Yes, the language… it’s old Majara language, spoken by many of the cultures that shared the continent of Miasina with Ikosians before their rise to prominence. Many of the ruins in Koth are written in it and, sadly, it is the language in which many of the blackest rituals and necromantic spells are formulated. You won’t find any books about it available in public circulations, I’m afraid. But let’s return to the matter of this assailant. This is the darkest of magic they used, and they can be up to no good if they’re throwing spells like that on academy students.”\r\n\r\nDeciding he couldn’t just backpedal now, Zorian nonetheless decided against mentioning time travel in any way and settled for making something up. He told Zenomir about him overhearing a plan to invade the city during the summer festival. At first he dismissed it as some kind of prank because of its ludicrous nature, but when the two cloaked figures noticed him eavesdropping and started throwing spells he didn’t recognize at him, he grew concerned. Zenomir took him a lot more seriously than Zorian thought he would, and told him to go home and leave everything up to him from now on.\r\n\r\nHuh. That went surprisingly well – at least Zenomir hadn’t dragged him off to the police station to give a statement right away, though he suspected something like that might be in his near future. He paced nervously around in his room, unable to sleep and steadily losing the fight to keep his growing apprehension in check. Smart or not, the deed was done, and now the only thing he could do was wait and see what the consequences of his decision would be. For him and for everyone.\r\n\r\nA knock on the door interrupted him. Strong, confident knocking that nonetheless only lasted for a second or two – completely unlike the knocking of anyone he knew.\r\n\r\n“Coming!” Zorian called out, suspecting it was someone coming to talk to him about the story he told Zenomir. “What can I- urk!”\r\n\r\nZorian stared dumbly at the blade sticking out of his chest, his mouth opening in an unvoiced scream. He had just enough time to look at his assailant – a short figure dressed in loose black clothes and a faceless white mask – before the blade was painfully wrenched out of his body and then immediately inserted again into his chest cavity. Again and again and again…\r\n\r\nWhen darkness consumed his vision he was actually glad he was dying. Being repeatedly stabbed in the chest hurts.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nZorian’s eyes abruptly shot open as sharp pain erupted from his stomach. His whole body convulsed, buckling against the object that fell on him, and suddenly he was wide awake, not a trace of drowsiness in his mind.\r\n\r\n“Good m-!”\r\n\r\nKirielle was cut off as Zorian shot upright, eyes wide in fright, gasping for breath. He was killed! They killed him! He told someone about the attack and he was killed that very evening! How the hell had they even found out that fast!? Was Zenomir in on the attack or were they just that well informed!?\r\n\r\n“Nightmare?” Kirielle asked.\r\n\r\nZorian breathed deeply, ignoring the phantom pain in his chest as he did so. “Yeah. Definitely a nightmare.”\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nZorian knew he should focus on what Ilsa was saying, but for the life of him his mind wouldn’t stop dwelling on what had happened. In retrospect, he shouldn’t be so surprised at that particular turn of events – an invasion of that scale cannot be kept secret without some hefty inside help, so of course they’d find out about anyone raising an alarm about them! And besides, if stopping the invasion had as simple a solution as notifying the law enforcement, surely Zach would have already done it and Zorian wouldn’t be repeating this month for the third time.\r\n\r\nAlthough, he was starting to develop a healthy dose of respect for these… restarts. This was the second time he died and he only went through this month thrice. He seemed prone to dying. Didn’t Zach say something about him always getting blown up in that initial barrage unless he did something about it?\r\n\r\nHe snapped back into the real world when he realized Ilsa had stopped talking and was looking at him intently. He gave her a questioning look.\r\n\r\n“Are you quite alright?” she asked, and Zorian noticed her glancing at his hands. Why would she-\r\n\r\nOh.\r\n\r\nHis hands were shaking. He was probably quite pale too, if the skin on his hands was of any indication. He rubbed his hands together a few times and then balled them up into fists to reassert control over them.\r\n\r\n“Not quite,” Zorian admitted. “But I will be. You don’t have to worry about it.”\r\n\r\nShe stared at him for a second longer and then nodded.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” she said. “Do you want me to teleport you to the Academy? I can’t imagine riding the train in the state you’re in is going to be very pleasant for you.”\r\n\r\nZorian blinked, at loss what to say. He disdained train travel at the best of times, so an offer like this was a godsend at the moment, but… why?\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to inconvenience you…” he tried.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, I was going there anyway,” she said. “It’s the least I could do for getting to you so late and taking the choice of your mentor away from you.”\r\n\r\nWell, that much was true. Xvim really was a horrible, useless mentor.\r\n\r\nZorian excused himself to tell mother he was leaving – which took way too long in his opinion, since mother wouldn’t stop bombarding him with questions about teleportation, suddenly concerned about his safety – before picking up his luggage and following Ilsa outside. He was actually a little excited, since he’d never teleported before. He’d have been even more excited, but the memory of being stabbed to death was still uncomfortably fresh, dampening his enthusiasm somewhat.\r\n\r\n“Ready?” she asked.\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, the rumors about the dangers of teleporting are mostly exaggerated,” Ilsa said. “You can’t get stuck inside solid objects – the spell doesn’t work that way – and if something goes wrong I’ll immediately know it and collapse the spell before dimensional ripples tear us apart.”\r\n\r\nZorian scowled. He already knew that, but saw no point in pointing that out – she obviously heard his little exchange with mother.\r\n\r\nIlsa started chanting and Zorian stood straighter, not wanting to miss-\r\n\r\nThe world rippled, then changed. Suddenly they were both standing in a well lit circular room, a large magical circle carved into the marble floor they stood on. There was no disorientation, no flash of colors, no nothing – almost disappointing. He studied the room they were in a little more closely, trying to understand where they were.\r\n\r\n“This is the teleport redirection point,” Ilsa said. “The academy wards shunt every incoming teleport into this place for security reasons. Of course, that’s assuming you’re properly keyed in and have sufficient authorization to teleport in at all.” She fixed him with a penetrating gaze. “Teleporting into a warded space is just one of the many dangers of the spell. Don’t experiment with it on your own.”\r\n\r\n“Err… I’m pretty sure teleport is far above my access level,” pointed out Zorian.\r\n\r\nShe shrugged. “Some students are capable of reconstructing a spell after seeing it performed only once. Once you know the chant and gestures, 80% of the work has already been done for you.”\r\n\r\nZorian blinked. Now why didn’t he think of that?\r\n\r\n“Would you mind casting that spell one more time?” he asked innocently. “Strictly for academic purposes, you see…”\r\n\r\nShe chuckled. “No. If it makes you feel any better, I doubt you have enough mana reserves to cast the spell even once.”\r\n\r\nAs a point of fact, it didn’t make him feel any better. He didn’t care how dangerous it was, he’d learn the teleport spell as soon as he was able. He just shaved off an entire day of train travel from his journey in an instant – the ability to do that kind of thing at will would be worth quite a lot of trouble to acquire. He let out a sigh and left Ilsa to her own devices to get settled in.\r\n\r\n“I could get used to this kind of travel,” Zorian mumbled to himself as he unlocked the door to his room and dropped his luggage to the floor in relief. “Too bad I could never fake distress convincingly enough, or else I’d convince Ilsa to take me along at the beginning of every restart.”\r\n\r\nHe froze mid-step. He shouldn’t be thinking like that. That was dangerous thinking. He had no proof that the restarts would keep happening indefinitely. In fact, everything he knew about magic told him it couldn’t be true – whatever spell had been put on him was going to run out of mana at some point and then there’d be no restart, no second chances… no return from the dead. He had to treat every restart as if it were his last, because it might very well be.\r\n\r\nThough he had to admit that, despite it ending with him getting stabbed to death, the previous restart wasn’t a complete disaster – at least he had all but confirmed it was Zach, and not the lich, that was responsible for this. Instead of researching unknown languages and time travel, it would probably be wiser to find out where Zach keeps disappearing to every time.\r\n\r\nBut not right now. He deserved a little rest after being brought back from the dead.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nHe really should have known it wouldn’t be that easy. The moment he tried to track down Zach, he was reminded of why he didn’t do that in his very first restart. Zach was not only an heir of Noble House Noveda – he was the only still living member of that House, the rest of his family having been killed in the Splinter Wars. Zach stood to inherit a sizeable financial empire and a legacy of several generations of mages once he came of age, so everything about him was scrutinized closely by a great number of interested parties. Consequently, his disappearance was a Big Deal, and a lot of people wanted to know where he went. Zorian was just one of these people, and if those people (and the people they hired) hadn’t managed to track him down, he had very little chance to do so. Needless to say, he didn’t get anywhere. Like he suspected, the two girls Zach hung out with during Zorian’s original month were nothing special without the Noveda heir there to help them out and hang out with them (and asking people about them led to some pretty annoying rumors being spread around; honestly, can’t a guy ask about a girl without everyone assuming he’s got a romantic interest in her?), his house was sealed with some pretty heavy ward-work, his legal guardian could not be reached, and if he had any close friends they weren’t among his classmates. Zorian wasn’t a detective, and had no idea what else to look for. And considering that many professional detectives had already failed (and continued to fail) to track the boy down, he suspected it wouldn’t help even if he did know a thing or two about tracking people down.\r\n\r\nA month went by with little to show for it. Summer festival came, and Zorian once again boarded a train out of Cyoria, awake and alert as the night deepened and minutes ticked away. He brought a pocket watch with him this time, and kept glancing at it every once in a while, silently praying that he wouldn’t have to start over once again but wanting to know exactly when he got thrown back in case he did. Sure enough, his prayers wouldn’t be answered. Somewhere around 2 past midnight he blacked out and woke up with Kiri on top of him, wishing him a good morning.\r\n\r\nHe probably should have admitted it to himself right then and there. He was a fairly smart person, after all, and not prone to deluding himself. Instead it took 4 more restarts before he accepted the truth of his predicament: he was stuck in some kind of a time loop, and it wasn’t going to end any time soon.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t know how it was possible. Maybe the spell was powered by Zach’s seemingly inexhaustible mana reserves instead of being limited to a fixed amount at the moment of casting. Maybe it was one of those rare self-sustaining spells. Hell, maybe it reached into the Heart of the World and drew power from the World Dragon itself! It didn’t really matter how it did it, only that it did.\r\n\r\nBut that’s retrospect – at the time he just refused to accept it, and instead tried to live like he normally would. It was rather boring, yes, but what if this particular restart was the one where it ended? The restart where the consequences of his choices would not magically disappear at 2 past midnight on the night of the festival (He checked and yes, it was consistent across all 4 restarts).\r\n\r\nHe was through with that though - he couldn’t go on like this. Excluding the invasion bit, the month had been a bore even the first time around, and he had lived through it eight times already. He knew the first month curriculum well enough by now to get near-perfect scores in all subjects, even warding. It had little effect on how people treated him, as he found out. He was known to be capable, and his grades had always been very good, so people weren’t really surprised if he aced all the exams or effortlessly performed a perfect magic missile on their very first combat magic class. It was within the realm of people’s expectations, unlike Zach’s sudden improvement. The only people whose behavior changed in response to his improvement were Akoja and Xvim. Akoja had gotten twice as annoying now that she apparently found a kindred soul, always insisting that they check each other’s work and asking him for help whenever she didn’t understand something. Zorian had thought she’d be green with jealousy that he was beating her scores, but it seemed she was a lot less bothered to be outdone by him, as opposed to by the likes of Zach and Neolu. Xvim took his superb scores as an indication that he should be held to an even higher standard. As such, not only did he not declare his pen-spinning good enough to move on to something else, he had demoted him back to the regular levitation exercise. In all honesty, Zorian wasn’t terribly bothered by that – even if he did master the pen-spinning exercise to Xvim’s satisfaction, no doubt he’d get nothing more than another minor variation of the basic three to practice.\r\n\r\nSo all in all, going through another boring month like that was out of the question. He took different electives this time – Astronomy, Architecture, and Geography of the Global Mana Flow – and he fully intended to bring down his academic scores back to normal so Xvim and Akoja would remain their normal, more tolerable selves. He also intended to skip quite a few time-consuming homework projects to focus on his own personal studies, and he was going to spend a sizeable portion of his savings on alchemical supplies. Should this restart be the final one, he was going to be seriously inconvenienced, but it wouldn’t be the end of the world, and he suspected the disruptions following in the wake of the invasion would render many of the normal concerns moot.\r\n\r\nThen he walked into the essential invocations classroom on the first day of school and realized his plans would have to be adjusted.\r\n\r\nZach was finally back in class.'),
('Country Roads', 'Beware of Chicken', 7, '“It was an honour meeting you, Brother Jin,” Tingfeng said, clasping his hands before him. “I pray that you will do us the honour of attending our marriage after the harvest.”\r\n\r\nI made the appropriate gestures too. “I won’t miss it, Brother Tingfeng.” I said, and really I meant it. Meihua and Tingfeng were good people. “But are you sure about these?”\r\n\r\nBy these, I meant the two young pigs I had been gifted. I was planning to build some more things first, but one does not refuse generosity lightly. Eh, at least I found the music shop while he was haggling with the person who sold him the cows. A pipa was kind of like a banjo, right?\r\n\r\n“Brother Jin, for what you did for us, I would buy you a thousand more, and it still would not be enough repayment.”\r\n\r\nI sighed internally. Well, Alright then. I hope Tingfeng doesn’t beggar himself by repaying everybody as extravagantly as he says he would. Even after I said he didn’t need to do anything for me. Fake boy was in prison, and shackled with about ten “spirit restrainers” some kind of qi suppression artifact that only worked if people were weak enough. Personally, I thought it was a bit overkill for such weak people, but eh, better safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nWe were in quite good spirits as we set out, back along the road to Meimei’s village. Xian jr was all over my back again, telling me to show him how I defeated the badguy, and I obligingly showed him several kung-fu moves I remembered from badly translated movies. He laughed at my “Hooah!”s, “Whatcha!”s and little flips.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful night. The moon was bright and full, and Lightbugs danced in the air, for what would likely be one of the last times before fall truly set in. If she was a poet, she might have been inspired. As it was, she was just content with what she could see. They were camped at the foot of one of the hills, and Jin had climbed higher up it to get a better view..\r\n\r\n“Meimei…” her father ventured, and she looked at him, absentmindedly stirring the stew she was cooking for their dinner.\r\n\r\n“Yes, father?” She asked.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to apologize to you, daughter. I did not take your words with the consideration they were due, and have shamed myself.” He bowed his head slightly to her in regret.\r\n\r\nWhile a part of her was hurt that nobody had believed her, the other part spoke that what she had said had been similarly unbelievable. Jin certainly did not act like any other cultivator she had heard of. “I forgive you, father.“\r\n\r\n“….It wasn’t a wolf that night, was it?” He asked after a moment.\r\n\r\n“It was the Wicked Blade.”\r\n\r\nHer father paled, and then let out a shaky laugh.\r\n\r\n“Well, we are truly blessed by heaven, then.” He decided.\r\n\r\nThey sat in companionable silence, until the stew was done. Meiling scooped up two bowls full, and turned to her father.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take this to Jin.” She said, “He isn’t too far.”\r\n\r\nHer father nodded, but spoke up when she started to walk away.\r\n\r\n“Meimei… should this be what you desire, go with my blessing.”\r\n\r\nHer face tinted red. “We’ve only known each other for five days, father.” She objected, but her heart wasn’t in it.\r\n\r\nThe trek up the hill was relatively easy, even with the trees and rocks, and holding two bowls of stew. She filled her nose, and her ears, until she found him. He was sitting on a large rock, instrument in hand.\r\n\r\nHe had his tongue stuck out in concentration, as he tried to play a tune she had never heard before on a pipa. He was holding it too far over, to the side over his knee, rather than upright, and kept hitting bum notes, or messing up the chords.\r\n\r\n“Jin, I bought you dinner.” She said quietly. He started, and then put his instrument to the side. And hopped off the rock.\r\n\r\n“Thank, you, Meiling.” He said earnestly, reaching out to take the bowl from her, when he paused, and glanced back up at the rock.\r\n\r\n“…want to come top with me?” he asked after a moment, seeming bashful. His face was a little red from embarrassment.\r\n\r\n“I’d love to.” She replied, and he was once more his more sure self. He scooped her up, cradling her against his chest, and jumped. He alighted on the rock with far more gentleness than she expected.\r\n\r\nThe view from the top of the rock was spectacular. It was placed just so that it was in a gap in the trees, allowing one to see out across the rest of the hills, illuminated by the full moon.\r\n\r\nThey sat in companionable silence on the rock, eating their dinner, and taking in the view. She was rather gratified by the small sounds of enjoyment coming from as he ate.\r\n\r\n“What song were you trying to play? I’ve never heard it before.” She finally asked, and his face flushed fully this time.\r\n\r\n“Its a song I heard in my…childhood.” he explained. “Its sung in a language not of this continent.”\r\n\r\n“Truly? I thought there was only one language men spoke.” Meiling sounded intrigued, but she supposed it made sense.\r\n\r\n“Mmm. The man who taught me it was from somewhere very, very far away.”\r\n\r\nThere was a cool breeze through the trees, and Meiling leaned up against him. Jin’s arm settled around her waist, and pulled her slightly closer.\r\n\r\n“Sing it for me?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I’m not a very good singer,” he demurred.\r\n\r\n“Can’t be any worse than your pipa playing.” she teased.\r\n\r\nJin laughed. “Alright, alright. Its your ears on the line here, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Almost heaven, West Virginia…”\r\n\r\nHis voice wasn’t beautiful, or particularly grand. It did nto stir the soul, or cause the land around him to weep. But it was nice enough.\r\n\r\nMeiling closed her eyes and relaxed, her fingers entwining with the hand on her stomach.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t know when she went from leaning on him, to in his lap.\r\n\r\nShe also didn’t know who started kissing who, but she realised her father was onto something.\r\n\r\nKissing under the moonlight was very nice.\r\n\r\nThe knowing grins they got when they returned were embarrassing, though. And Meihua wanted all the details.\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\nI was finally alone again, on my way back to my farm. I would have been home last night, but Meimei insisted that she make me the dumplings she had promised me.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you, angry cat Meimei was cute as hell. Meimei in an apron, smiling and serving me a home cooked meal did things for me. Mmm.\r\n\r\nI think I’m going to marry that girl. Only known her for a few days? Well, this could end in glory or tears, but damn it, I’m gonna go for it.\r\n\r\nBut my farm is not yet ready for another person let alone kids. I’ve got work to do.\r\n\r\nI felt a fire in my gut, and I lifted. The cart came off the ground, as I just started carrying it. The chickens squalled, Chunky and Peppa oinked in shock, but the miles disappeared under my feet.\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\nBi De’s eyes snapped open. His Great Master’s presence was near.\r\n\r\nHe swept off the Great Pillars of the Fa Ram. He checked the coop, to find it spotless. He plucked the few interloping parasites from the Heavenly Herbs. He arranged the seeds he had collected that felt slightly of Qi upon the table for further perusal. He hoped his tribute would be well received, as repayment for his Great Master’s generosity.\r\n\r\nHe arranged the corpses of the Wicked ones on Great Pillars, so that his master may see his kills. A small, long member of Basi Bu Shi’s ilk. Another was a beast that shared the same form as him, but far less noble, with a hooked beak, and grasping talons.\r\n\r\nNow he stood, a sentinel at the entrance of the Fa Ram. His females were arranged behind him, clucking and wandering as was their wont.\r\n\r\nHis Great Master crested the horizon, moving at speed.\r\n\r\nBi De swept into a bow, kowtowing before his Lord, as was only proper.\r\n\r\nHis Great Master scratched his wattles in greeting, and took a deep breath of this Blessed Land’s air.\r\n\r\n“Lets get to work.” He said, and brought his disciple up to rest upon his broad shoulders.

('Crime Spree', 'Cinnamon Bun', 4, '\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have snuffed out the unlife of ‘Sentinel Ghost of Threewells by Darkwood’ Level 1! Bonus Exp was granted for ending a monster above your level!\r\n\r\nI sniffled and held Bonesy close as I watched the ghost fade away. It was the third ghost I’d killed, the third that had responded to my friendly request with nothing but murder and meanness.\r\n\r\nI had moved towards the main street of Threewells, or at least the street that bisected the town from one wall to the next. I tried to keep low and go slow, only poking my head up to peek into windows and try to spot any more ghosts. So far, I had been lucky.\r\n\r\nThe first few homes were normal enough, with little dining rooms and fireplaces and some quaint furniture. No plates on the tables or signs that people had left in a hurry, so whatever struck the town must have come with some warning.\r\n\r\nThe fourth house in the row was way larger, with thick double doors and a third floor under its peaked roof. A rusty sign out front hinted that it was a shop of some sort, but the sign was unreadable except for the design that was either a chimney or a well. Probably a well.\r\n\r\nI stood up on tippy toes to see into the big window at the front, then dipped down when I caught sight of not one, but two ghosts floating around lazily within. “Oh no,” I whispered. “Bonesy, what do I do?”\r\n\r\n“Rrrr.”\r\n\r\nI was climbing back up to take another peek when a ghastly hand tore out of the wall and grabbed my face. Icy coldness seeped into me before I jerked my head back, but the grip was too strong.\r\n\r\nDesperate for leverage, I put a foot against the wall and kicked off, tearing myself free of the ghost\'s grasp, but not without the burning hot sensation of three cuts across my face. I wanted to scream, but that would just make things worse.\r\n\r\nI picked Bonesy from where it had rolled and spun to face my attackers.\r\n\r\nThe second ghost was coming out of the wall slowly, but the first, the one with the bloody hand, was almost out already. Moving through things slowed them down, which meant that this was my chance.\r\n\r\nBonesy swished through the first ghost with a gleeful ‘Rreee,’ then, after I had caught my balance again, I swiped the bone-topped staff through once more.\r\n\r\nThe ghost was looking worse for wear, but the attacks had taken time, and now it was joined by its brother. A glance around revealed a third ghost floating towards me from across the street.\r\n\r\nI could have stood my ground and fought, but even with one ghost nearly re-dead I didn’t like my odds. I aimed for the nearest alleyway and ran.\r\n\r\nIf my sense of direction wasn’t completely off, it led to a spot near the hole in the wall where I had found Bonesy. I stumbled into the backyard of the large building and, after a glance to make sure it was ghostless, spun around.\r\n\r\nThe three ghosts were lined up now, all of them floating towards me with murder in their eyes.\r\n\r\nI licked my lips and tasted the blood from my cheek. My cheek that the ghost’s hand had failed to pass through. I was magic.\r\n\r\nOr magical enough that they couldn’t phase through me. Or they could unphase their hands for the purposes of chopping innocent teenagers up into bite-sized pieces.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t going to test anything.\r\n\r\nThe first ghost arrived and was greeted with a smack from Bonesy. The ghost, already injured earlier, broke apart in a fine mist. Its brother ghosts didn’t seem to mind all that much, or maybe they were even angrier, but only had one angry facial expression to work with and couldn’t display their heightened rage.\r\n\r\nI didn’t know and didn’t care. Bonesy swooshed through the next ghost, first down, then up, then down again. The ghost caught the haft, wood smacking into its hand a couple of feet above its translucent head.\r\n\r\nI stared.\r\n\r\nThe ghost stared.\r\n\r\nBonesy stared at the wall.\r\n\r\nWith a crunch, the ghost crushed my spear, rendering it down to mere splinters where it had caught it. Then gravity did its thing and dragged Bonesy down through its ghostly body, killing it on the spot.\r\n\r\n“Rrar,” Bonesy said, rejoicing in its victory.\r\n\r\n“W-well done!” I said before the last ghost moved over Bonesy and completely blocked my path to my only weapons. “Ah, can we... negotiate? Please?”\r\n\r\nThe ghost didn’t care.\r\n\r\nI could have run, but that would have meant abandoning Bonesy and also I wasn’t sure if the backyard had an exit or not, not unless I snuck back into the wall, then up to the second floor, then down the side of the tower again.\r\n\r\nIt was a bad idea. The ghost could cut me off at any moment.\r\n\r\nInstead, I brought my haversack around, the one holding my showerhead, and held it out in front of me. “I’m sorry!” I shouted as I charged at the ghost.\r\n\r\nAs slow moving as it was, the ghost didn’t have time to so much as twitch before I rammed into him.\r\n\r\nCold. So very cold, but also wispy, like standing in front of an air conditioner with nothing on but an oversized t-shirt.\r\n\r\nI shot through the ghost, suddenly meeting no resistance. Took two tumbling steps and tripped over Bonesy to land on the ground with a splat. Fortunately, I had my trusty haversack to break my fall. The sack that currently held the very sharp, very pointy showerhead glyph.\r\n\r\n“Owie,” I whined. Turning around, I looked up in time to see the final ghost fade away into a cloud of whitish dust. “Oh, thank the stars,” I said.\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have caused three (3) enemies (‘Sentinel Ghost of Threewells by Darkwood’ Level 1! x3) to give up the ghost! Bonus Exp was granted for killing three (3) monsters above your level!\r\n\r\nBing Bong! Congratulations, your Cinnamon Bun class has reached level 1!\r\nStamina +5\r\nFlexibility +5\r\nYou have gained: One Class Point\r\n\r\n“A what?” I asked. Then a wash of heat running through my entire body distracted me for a moment. It was nice, like being tucked into bed by my mom and getting a warm kiss on the forehead from dad right after.\r\n\r\nStill, the sensation faded a moment later and I decided that I had spent enough time staring at the sky as it appeared between two buildings. It was getting darker by the moment. I would need to find shelter soon.\r\n\r\nBut first...\r\n\r\nClass Points: One\r\nClass points are used to upgrade a Class Skill.\r\n\r\n“O-kay?” I wasn’t going to waste that on cleaning just yet.\r\n\r\nBonesy was still stuck to a chunk of wood, but the weapon was now more of a mace than a staff or spear. That’s what I got for working with sub-par materials.\r\n\r\nI walked through the streets with a bit more confidence. I now knew that I could run through ghosts to dispatch them. Sorta. Anyway, they were now on my level, literally. It didn’t help that I didn’t know how many there were in the town, but that didn’t matter.\r\n\r\nI moved over to one of the smaller houses I had seen, one of three next to the big. I peek through the window, miraculously still intact, showing nothing of worth, so I pulled the door open.\r\n\r\nThe squeal of rusty hinges had me tensing, but nothing showed up to eat me. Instead, I found the inside of the house to be a horrible mess. There was a crate to one side, a bunch of things tossed into it, furniture was laying all over the place and the paint over one wall was discoloured as if a painting had been taken.\r\n\r\nLooters, maybe? Or people packing up in a hurry?\r\n\r\nThe home was simple. Four rooms. A small kitchen, a dining area, and a bedroom along one side. There was even a small bathroom tucked away in a corner. It was all messy, horribly, horribly messy.\r\n\r\nBut I had a skill for that!\r\n\r\nI found an old broom and even a feather duster laying around, as well as some soap in a little pan. The items in the house were in far better condition than those outside. Which wasn’t saying much, really, the place was moldy and dirty and drafty.\r\n\r\nStill, I started cleaning and exploring. The blankets for the bed were flung out the back door and into a sort of bin I suspected was for composting, judging by the little garden space out back. Then I patted down the thin mattress and found it... usable, if barely. Then came the dusting and the broom and and the tossing out of trash, all done with a speed and ease that surprised me a little. Maybe that’s what a rank E in Cleaning really meant.\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank E - 44%\r\n\r\nI blinked at the rise in experience. It was getting close, and I still needed some essentials. Like food.\r\n\r\nScrewing up my courage, I snuck out of the house and visited the neighbour’s place. It was in a much worse shape, the roof having caved in and obvious water damage ruining the floor. I didn’t do much, merely dusted a little, tossed out some things and searched for anything handy, but other than a fire poker that might have served as a non-anti-ghost weapon there wasn’t much.\r\n\r\nThe third house is where I struck gold. Or rather, silver.\r\n\r\nThis home was a bit bigger than the others, with a cellar below and a second bedroom within and a sort of little workshop in the back. The tools were all gone except for some gardening implements that were more rust than anything else.\r\n\r\nThe interior was still furnished. Chairs and tables and beds that still had sheets over them. The closets and chests hid some moth-eaten clothes and the little pantry next to the kitchen had some lumps that might have been bread at one time.\r\n\r\nAt the back were three jars, each filled with liquid gold. “Honey!” I squealed as I brought the glass jars closer. The orange-ish stuff within looked hard and it was heavy in my hands, but recognizable still. Some prying and sweating later and the jar opened with a pop. A sniff, then a lick proved it to be just that.\r\n\r\nI resealed the jar and went back to searching, almost absentmindedly cleaning as I did so.\r\n\r\nEverything that looked edible went onto a freshly wiped table. This place was nice. With few windows from which a monster or ghost could see me and enough stuff that I could pass the night.\r\n\r\nChoice made, I got to cleaning, and it’s thanks to that that I found a loose floorboard. By the time I pried it open with a fire poker it was going dark outside, but not so much that I couldn’t marvel at the six pieces of silver I had found.\r\n\r\nI was rich! Maybe.\r\n\r\nSix silver, a fire poker, three medium-ish sized jars of honey, a jar of vinegar that I suspected was apple cider, three unopened bottles of wine and a block of what I hoped was salt wrapped in waxy paper. Not exactly a feast, but I retrieved a clean-ish spoon and took a few scrapes of honey. It was nice and sweet, but didn’t go so well with the sip of vinegar I tried.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t going to starve, which was nice. I just had to make sure to survive the night.\r\n\r\nI moved blankets over the windows where curtains once hung and made a nice bed for myself with the nicer bundles of clothes I could find in the middle of the living room. Bonesy kept me company, a thin cloth over his face serving to keep it quiet.\r\n\r\n“Good night, Bonesy,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Rrr,” the skull replied.\r\n\r\nI laid down and thought of my adventure so far. Of discovering a tiny corner of a huge land and of fighting mean ghosts.\r\n\r\nThe smile wouldn’t keep off my face even as I fell asleep while faint glows appeared and faded beyond the windows of my tiny abode.'),
('Dungeon Dive', 'Cinnamon Bun', 10, 'Bing Bong! Congratulations, your Cinnamon Bun class has reached level 2!\r\nHealth + 5\r\nResilience +5\r\nYou have gained: One Class Point\r\nYou have unlocked: One Class Skill Slot\r\n\r\n“A skill slot?” I wondered aloud even as a rush of giddiness washed through me. It was like a faint tingling, first in my skin, then my muscles and the insides of my chest, as if someone had placed me in a microwave on high for a few seconds, but without the exploding.\r\n\r\nI grinned. I was level two!\r\n\r\nNormally, that would have been a time of celebration and dancing and such, but I was right next to a giant evil hole in the ground and it kind of felt unwise to make lots of noise while so close to the scary pit.\r\n\r\nInstead, I looked around, took in the bright sunlight streaming down on the sight of the battlefield where I had fought the wraith and soaked in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe hole didn’t drop straight down, not for more than a meter and a half or so. The passage went on into the dark as some sort of tunnel that I couldn’t see the end of. I was going to need a ladder or else getting out of there would be complicated.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I had seen one next to the gardening shed of one of the houses I’d explored. Unfortunately it was all the way across town.\r\n\r\nThere weren’t any other options, so I took a leisurely stroll across town, found the ladder where it had been left, tested the rungs a few times to make sure they could hold my weight, then dragged it all the way back.\r\n\r\nThe moment my foot touched the ground within the hole a prompt appeared before me.\r\n\r\nYou are Entering the Wonderland Dungeon\r\nDungeon Level 2-4\r\nYour entire party has entered the Dungeon\r\nSeal Dungeon until exit?\r\n\r\n“That sounds like an awful idea,” I said.\r\n\r\nDungeon left Unsealed\r\nAny Person can Enter Dungeon Instance\r\nAny Person can Exit Dungeon Instance\r\n\r\nQuest Updated!\r\nThe Hole Down Under\r\nAn evil root has plunged into the world.\r\nYou have entered the Wonderland Dungeon. Explore it. Find the root. Destroy it.\r\n\r\nI let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding and counted myself lucky. It felt as if I had dodged a bullet there. Still, level two to four monsters would probably be really tricky to fight. But maybe I didn’t need to fight them?\r\n\r\nDropping my backpack, I searched within until I found the silvery candlestick I had looted and a fresh candle. Then I lost a minute or two with the firestarter until the candle lit up with a spark. I replaced the firestarter and stood back up, the candle holder held before me so that the mirror shield it had illuminated the path ahead.\r\n\r\nThe passage was like a borehole, the walls smooth dirt except where the occasional root poked through and the ground tilted down at a slight angle. I tread carefully, always watching where I set my feet in case of traps or pitfalls or anything of the sort. I had read enough about dungeons to know that being careful was the best way to survive them.\r\n\r\nThe path curved a little, then opened up to a large-ish room with a wooden door at one end and a monster in the middle. A torch high up on the wall near the door lit everything up with a warm, orange glow.\r\n\r\nI froze, taking in the form of a dog-sized rabbit standing on its haunches, milky-white eyes staring at a pocket watch that it, he, held out before him in a big fluffy paw. The rabbit wasn’t normal, not just on account of its size and the fact that it was wearing a tattered waistcoat. Its fur was missing in places and its teeth were showing where the flesh around its mouth was rotted off.\r\n\r\nI fired off a quick insight as I stood still and wondered what to do.\r\n\r\nA zombie time rabbit, level 2.\r\n\r\nI realized that I might be in something of a pickle. Still, I was Broccoli Bunch and Broccoli Bunch was nothing if not polite. “Ah, hello,” I said.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit’s head looked up. Its white eyes locked onto me. The timepiece clicked.\r\n\r\nThen the rabbit reappeared in the air right before me, both legs already kicking out into my chest.\r\n\r\nI stumbled back, breath whooshing out of me in gasp as I fell onto my backpack and laid down to stare at the dirt ceiling for a moment. “Ouch,” I said as soon as I had air in my lungs.\r\n\r\nThe timepiece clicked. The rabbit appeared above me.\r\n\r\nI swept an arm out, hitting the zombie rabbit just hard enough to shove it off to the side and avoid another thumping. Then there was a mad scramble as I slid my arms out of the loops of my backpack and rolled off to the side. I didn’t have any weapons except my cleaning magic, and the rabbit could teleport.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t looking too good. “Mister rabbit, please stop!” I said.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit turned its white eyes towards me, then pressed on the button next to the timepiece again.\r\n\r\nThis time I rolled out of the way before it even appeared to kick me again. “Okay, okay, Broc, it’s a time travelling zombie bunny rabbit,” I said as I shuffled around the room, constantly moving as I kept an eye on the rabbit. “It’s an evil time travelling zombie bunny rabbit. K-killing it is okay.”\r\n\r\nThe rabbit’s head snapped around to face me, turning way more than its neck should have allowed.\r\n\r\nThe pocket watch clicked. My hand shot out and wrapped around its furry chest a moment after it appeared before me.\r\n\r\nIt was heavy, heavy enough that I ended up backing up and bumping into the wall, but I managed to hang on to it long enough to use my one spell.\r\n\r\nA wave of cleaning magic tore through the rabbit, its white eyes went glossy and a faint ghostly form shifted out of the body.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank goodness,” I said as I let it drop and moved away. That had taken more than a third of my mana, more than a ghost did. But still, it was over. I waited for the ‘ding’ and the experience points to come in.\r\n\r\nThe timepiece clicked.\r\n\r\nSpinning around, I found the rabbit back in the middle of the room, its head turned towards me with its white eyes set in a glare. “Oh no.”\r\n\r\nThe rabbit bounced across the floor in a straight path for me. I tried to move away, but the room was far too small, so I did the only thing I could think of. I jumped over the rabbit.\r\n\r\nDing! For doing a Special Action in line with your Class, you have unlocked the skill: Jumping!\r\n\r\n“Not now!” I told the infobox.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit was slow to turn around, which was just what I needed. My hand locked around the timepiece and tore it out of its grip to send it flying against the nearest wall where it burst apart. Then came another wave of cleaning magic.\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have stuffed a ‘Undead White Rabbit Time Mage’ Level 2!\r\n\r\nI shuffled away from the body of the rabbit as it started to dissolve into motes of whitish light that left nothing behind, even the bits of its timepiece fading away. “I’m sorry,” I said before using a bit of mana to clean off my hands. A clink sounded and a key appeared on the ground where the rabbit had been.\r\n\r\nMana 19/105\r\n\r\nThat wasn’t very good. I hoped that Dungeon monsters didn’t respawn, then I felt bad for calling the rabbit a monster. Sure, it was a time travelling zombie rabbit, but I was the one invading its house. I bet that it used to be a very nice rabbit before it went all zombie and mean.\r\n\r\nMaybe that’s what the quest was about: Destroy the root of evil in this dungeon and allow it to become a less evil place? It made a sort of sense.\r\n\r\nI stared down at my hands, my perfectly clean hands, made that way thanks to some magic and not any effort of my own. Hands that I felt should have been at least a little dirty.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t some crusader, or the person who got to decide what was right and wrong. I had been asked, by something, to come rid the world of something evil, and that’s what I was trying to do, but I didn’t want to compromise my morality to do it.\r\n\r\nMy hands clenched into fists. “So I won’t,” I decided. I had made friends with all sorts of people already. And maybe I could make even more in this dungeon. Maybe it was an evil place and I couldn’t. I didn’t know yet, but I would learn and I would ask the people I met to be friends first before I ever raised a fist against them.\r\n\r\nI nodded. “Right!” My choice was... not made, because that had been my path already, but reaffirmed.\r\n\r\nJumping\r\nRank F - 00%\r\nThe ability to jump. As this skill rises in level your ability to jump will improve!\r\n\r\nA glance at my new skill didn’t reveal all that much. It wasn’t... well, it wasn’t Fireball. Jumping could be useful... maybe? For getting to high places?\r\n\r\n“My skills are really lame,” I whined.\r\n\r\nStill, it was a skill, and at rank F it wasn’t that handy. I skipped over to the door, then looked at the experience change. It had gone up a full percent. Maybe I could grind it here before moving on, then. I had another skill that was nearly at the next level too.\r\n\r\nThe door to the next area had a large lock on it. It didn’t take a genius to see that it was the key that had dropped from the rabbit. Next to the door was a little table with a potion bottle and a cake on it. The cake had ‘EAT ME’ written on it in big letters, the bottle had a small tag with ‘DRINK THIS’ scribbled on it. I fired off two quick Insights.\r\n\r\n“Is that... is that an Alice in Wonderland reference?” I asked aloud. “Insight.”\r\n\r\nA poisoned cake\r\n\r\nA poisoned shrinking potion\r\n\r\nI eyed the cake and the potion, then carefully took the potion and brought it back to my backpack to tuck it away. There was a chance it would come in handy later. Then I checked my notifications.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Through repeated actions your Insight skill has improved and is now eligible for rank up!\r\nRank D is a free rank!\r\n\r\nThat was an easy choice to make.\r\n\r\nInsight\r\nRank D - 00%\r\nThe Ability to know something. The knowledge you gain is further increased.\r\n\r\nI stretched, jumped on the spot a few times, then looked to the door as I slid my backpack back on. I didn’t know how ready I was to face off the rest of the dungeon, but I wouldn’t learn that until I tried. I got my makeshift flail ready, just in case I ran into more zombies or ghosts, then unlocked the door to step out into the rest of the dungeon.\r\n\r\nMy breath caught.\r\n\r\nThe passageway continued for a few feet, then opened up onto a railless balcony overlooking a large hole. It was maybe ten or twenty meters wide, with an opened top that revealed the bright green sky above. There were other platforms at different levels, with huge, bulbous mushrooms growing in a spiraling ring all around the sides of the shaft. It seemed as if the level I was on was the highest one around.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty, with glowing moss along the walls, little trees sticking out here and there with huge caterpillars on them and pretty pink clouds floating above. Pretty, surreal, and nothing like the world I had left when I entered the dungeon.\r\n\r\n“Whoa,” I said as I moved to the edge of the ledge and looked down. Every quarter turn of the shaft had a hole drilled into the wall, some with elaborate arches, others quite plain. All the way down to the bottom where a field of grass was waiting and a large vine-covered archway. It would have looked idyllic if the pervasive sense of wrong wasn’t so strong whenever I looked at the tunnel behind that arch.\r\n\r\nThat had to be my objective then.\r\n\r\nAnd the only way to reach it was to jump from mushroom to mushroom. Maybe Jumping wasn’t a waste of skill after all.'),

Probably a well.\r\n\r\nI stood up on tippy toes to see into the big window at the front, then dipped down when I caught sight of not one, but two ghosts floating around lazily within. “Oh no,” I whispered. “Bonesy, what do I do?”\r\n\r\n“Rrrr.”\r\n\r\nI was climbing back up to take another peek when a ghastly hand tore out of the wall and grabbed my face. Icy coldness seeped into me before I jerked my head back, but the grip was too strong.\r\n\r\nDesperate for leverage, I put a foot against the wall and kicked off, tearing myself free of the ghost\'s grasp, but not without the burning hot sensation of three cuts across my face. I wanted to scream, but that would just make things worse.\r\n\r\nI picked Bonesy from where it had rolled and spun to face my attackers.\r\n\r\nThe second ghost was coming out of the wall slowly, but the first, the one with the bloody hand, was almost out already. Moving through things slowed them down, which meant that this was my chance.\r\n\r\nBonesy swished through the first ghost with a gleeful ‘Rreee,’ then, after I had caught my balance again, I swiped the bone-topped staff through once more.\r\n\r\nThe ghost was looking worse for wear, but the attacks had taken time, and now it was joined by its brother. A glance around revealed a third ghost floating towards me from across the street.\r\n\r\nI could have stood my ground and fought, but even with one ghost nearly re-dead I didn’t like my odds. I aimed for the nearest alleyway and ran.\r\n\r\nIf my sense of direction wasn’t completely off, it led to a spot near the hole in the wall where I had found Bonesy. I stumbled into the backyard of the large building and, after a glance to make sure it was ghostless, spun around.\r\n\r\nThe three ghosts were lined up now, all of them floating towards me with murder in their eyes.\r\n\r\nI licked my lips and tasted the blood from my cheek. My cheek that the ghost’s hand had failed to pass through. I was magic.\r\n\r\nOr magical enough that they couldn’t phase through me. Or they could unphase their hands for the purposes of chopping innocent teenagers up into bite-sized pieces.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t going to test anything.\r\n\r\nThe first ghost arrived and was greeted with a smack from Bonesy. The ghost, already injured earlier, broke apart in a fine mist. Its brother ghosts didn’t seem to mind all that much, or maybe they were even angrier, but only had one angry facial expression to work with and couldn’t display their heightened rage.\r\n\r\nI didn’t know and didn’t care. Bonesy swooshed through the next ghost, first down, then up, then down again. The ghost caught the haft, wood smacking into its hand a couple of feet above its translucent head.\r\n\r\nI stared.\r\n\r\nThe ghost stared.\r\n\r\nBonesy stared at the wall.\r\n\r\nWith a crunch, the ghost crushed my spear, rendering it down to mere splinters where it had caught it. Then gravity did its thing and dragged Bonesy down through its ghostly body, killing it on the spot.\r\n\r\n“Rrar,” Bonesy said, rejoicing in its victory.\r\n\r\n“W-well done!” I said before the last ghost moved over Bonesy and completely blocked my path to my only weapons. “Ah, can we... negotiate? Please?”\r\n\r\nThe ghost didn’t care.\r\n\r\nI could have run, but that would have meant abandoning Bonesy and also I wasn’t sure if the backyard had an exit or not, not unless I snuck back into the wall, then up to the second floor, then down the side of the tower again.\r\n\r\nIt was a bad idea. The ghost could cut me off at any moment.\r\n\r\nInstead, I brought my haversack around, the one holding my showerhead, and held it out in front of me. “I’m sorry!” I shouted as I charged at the ghost.\r\n\r\nAs slow moving as it was, the ghost didn’t have time to so much as twitch before I rammed into him.\r\n\r\nCold. So very cold, but also wispy, like standing in front of an air conditioner with nothing on but an oversized t-shirt.\r\n\r\nI shot through the ghost, suddenly meeting no resistance. Took two tumbling steps and tripped over Bonesy to land on the ground with a splat. Fortunately, I had my trusty haversack to break my fall. The sack that currently held the very sharp, very pointy showerhead glyph.\r\n\r\n“Owie,” I whined. Turning around, I looked up in time to see the final ghost fade away into a cloud of whitish dust. “Oh, thank the stars,” I said.\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have caused three (3) enemies (‘Sentinel Ghost of Threewells by Darkwood’ Level 1! x3) to give up the ghost! Bonus Exp was granted for killing three (3) monsters above your level!\r\n\r\nBing Bong! Congratulations, your Cinnamon Bun class has reached level 1!\r\nStamina +5\r\nFlexibility +5\r\nYou have gained: One Class Point\r\n\r\n“A what?” I asked. Then a wash of heat running through my entire body distracted me for a moment. It was nice, like being tucked into bed by my mom and getting a warm kiss on the forehead from dad right after.\r\n\r\nStill, the sensation faded a moment later and I decided that I had spent enough time staring at the sky as it appeared between two buildings. It was getting darker by the moment. I would need to find shelter soon.\r\n\r\nBut first...\r\n\r\nClass Points: One\r\nClass points are used to upgrade a Class Skill.\r\n\r\n“O-kay?” I wasn’t going to waste that on cleaning just yet.\r\n\r\nBonesy was still stuck to a chunk of wood, but the weapon was now more of a mace than a staff or spear. That’s what I got for working with sub-par materials.\r\n\r\nI walked through the streets with a bit more confidence. I now knew that I could run through ghosts to dispatch them. Sorta. Anyway, they were now on my level, literally. It didn’t help that I didn’t know how many there were in the town, but that didn’t matter.\r\n\r\nI moved over to one of the smaller houses I had seen, one of three next to the big. I peek through the window, miraculously still intact, showing nothing of worth, so I pulled the door open.\r\n\r\nThe squeal of rusty hinges had me tensing, but nothing showed up to eat me. Instead, I found the inside of the house to be a horrible mess. There was a crate to one side, a bunch of things tossed into it, furniture was laying all over the place and the paint over one wall was discoloured as if a painting had been taken.\r\n\r\nLooters, maybe? Or people packing up in a hurry?\r\n\r\nThe home was simple. Four rooms. A small kitchen, a dining area, and a bedroom along one side. There was even a small bathroom tucked away in a corner. It was all messy, horribly, horribly messy.\r\n\r\nBut I had a skill for that!\r\n\r\nI found an old broom and even a feather duster laying around, as well as some soap in a little pan. The items in the house were in far better condition than those outside. Which wasn’t saying much, really, the place was moldy and dirty and drafty.\r\n\r\nStill, I started cleaning and exploring. The blankets for the bed were flung out the back door and into a sort of bin I suspected was for composting, judging by the little garden space out back. Then I patted down the thin mattress and found it... usable, if barely. Then came the dusting and the broom and and the tossing out of trash, all done with a speed and ease that surprised me a little. Maybe that’s what a rank E in Cleaning really meant.\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank E - 44%\r\n\r\nI blinked at the rise in experience. It was getting close, and I still needed some essentials. Like food.\r\n\r\nScrewing up my courage, I snuck out of the house and visited the neighbour’s place. It was in a much worse shape, the roof having caved in and obvious water damage ruining the floor. I didn’t do much, merely dusted a little, tossed out some things and searched for anything handy, but other than a fire poker that might have served as a non-anti-ghost weapon there wasn’t much.\r\n\r\nThe third house is where I struck gold. Or rather, silver.\r\n\r\nThis home was a bit bigger than the others, with a cellar below and a second bedroom within and a sort of little workshop in the back. The tools were all gone except for some gardening implements that were more rust than anything else.\r\n\r\nThe interior was still furnished. Chairs and tables and beds that still had sheets over them. The closets and chests hid some moth-eaten clothes and the little pantry next to the kitchen had some lumps that might have been bread at one time.\r\n\r\nAt the back were three jars, each filled with liquid gold. “Honey!” I squealed as I brought the glass jars closer. The orange-ish stuff within looked hard and it was heavy in my hands, but recognizable still. Some prying and sweating later and the jar opened with a pop. A sniff, then a lick proved it to be just that.\r\n\r\nI resealed the jar and went back to searching, almost absentmindedly cleaning as I did so.\r\n\r\nEverything that looked edible went onto a freshly wiped table. This place was nice. With few windows from which a monster or ghost could see me and enough stuff that I could pass the night.\r\n\r\nChoice made, I got to cleaning, and it’s thanks to that that I found a loose floorboard. By the time I pried it open with a fire poker it was going dark outside, but not so much that I couldn’t marvel at the six pieces of silver I had found.\r\n\r\nI was rich! Maybe.\r\n\r\nSix silver, a fire poker, three medium-ish sized jars of honey, a jar of vinegar that I suspected was apple cider, three unopened bottles of wine and a block of what I hoped was salt wrapped in waxy paper. Not exactly a feast, but I retrieved a clean-ish spoon and took a few scrapes of honey. It was nice and sweet, but didn’t go so well with the sip of vinegar I tried.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t going to starve, which was nice. I just had to make sure to survive the night.\r\n\r\nI moved blankets over the windows where curtains once hung and made a nice bed for myself with the nicer bundles of clothes I could find in the middle of the living room. Bonesy kept me company, a thin cloth over his face serving to keep it quiet.\r\n\r\n“Good night, Bonesy,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Rrr,” the skull replied.\r\n\r\nI laid down and thought of my adventure so far. Of discovering a tiny corner of a huge land and of fighting mean ghosts.\r\n\r\nThe smile wouldn’t keep off my face even as I fell asleep while faint glows appeared and faded beyond the windows of my tiny abode.');

('Exam Prep 1', 'Forge of Destiny', 10, '\r\n\r\nLing Qi rubbed her eyes, trying to banish the blur of exhaustion. Scattered on the table before her were a half dozen opened scrolls, dense with text and diagrams. The archive supervisor had been able to explain the Archive’s organization, but even limiting her search to arts which only needed a single heart meridian for the initial level, the number she had to sift through had been vast.\r\n\r\nThere were no windows in the archive, only hanging lanterns that burned without flame, but Ling Qi suspected that it was nearing sunrise. There were simply so many options, and she could only take a single one. Each art would allow her to perform feats that she could not have imagined a scarce few weeks ago.\r\n\r\nThe Burning Heart Art would allow her to inspire courage and banish fear, as well as project blazing heat in the wake of her movements. The Earthroot Art would fill her limbs with strength and slow enemies with the weighty energies of the earth. The Crimson Flowing Art would allow her to sense the flow of blood in things around her and staunch her own wounds with a thought.\r\n\r\nAnd these were only a few of the available arts!\r\n\r\nLing Qi’s gaze drifted to another scroll on the table. Zephyr’s Breath Art was a set of techniques for manipulating the currents of air around the user to speed allies and impede foes. It was an art for making projectiles fly true and for avoiding direct confrontation.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it fit her well. But did she want it? She was a cultivator now, she could… should do whatever she wanted. Did she want to keep running away?\r\n\r\nLing Qi let out an explosive sigh. She was being silly; looking at her peers, she had no business being able to simply do as she pleased. Elder Su had mentioned that her qi had a natural wind nature so Zephyr’s Breath really was her best choice for being able to quickly defend herself.\r\n\r\nIt was only a first choice after all, and meridians could be re-attuned. Ling Qi decisively snatched up the scroll. She wavered as she stood up but shook her head, took control of her breathing, and cycled her qi to push the exhaustion back for the moment.\r\n\r\nOnce she cleaned up and traded the scroll for the jade slip encoded with its contents, she could get some sleep. She just hoped that she didn’t end up missing Elder Su’s lesson by oversleeping.\r\n\r\nDays passed, and Ling Qi found limited success in getting her new art to work. The finesse required to create more than directionless bursts of wind eluded her yet, and channeling the flows of qi left her feeling exhausted, her single meridian burning with discomfort. It seemed that her body needed more tempering yet.\r\n\r\nShe was not yet ready to make use of her art, but that day would come soon if she kept working hard. She was sure of it. Elder Su’s lessons were slowly improving her ability to cycle and manipulate qi. Mastering the next stage of Argent Soul also promised great improvements to her stamina, and in a few days, she was going to be meeting that girl, Li Suyin, to share cultivation ideas.\r\n\r\nAs for Elder Zhou... Well, his lessons continued to be both blessing and trial.\r\n\r\nLing Qi’s limbs trembled with exhaustion, her muscles burning from the strain of holding herself in the difficult pose Instructor Zhou had forced them to take up for meditation this week. The meditation had begun with simple stretches but had quickly progressed to difficult and highly uncomfortable exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuscles she didn\'t even know she had were sore, and the sweat trickling down her forehead despite the mountain chill kept stinging her eyes. Ling Qi doggedly kept her attention on Instructor Zhou as he paced between the rows of disciples, muscular arms clasped behind his back.\r\n\r\n“As a cultivator, you cannot afford to neglect any part of your body. Physical cultivation is, at its core, an endless exercise in balance and unity. Lose that balance or cultivate some part out of sync and you will tear your own body apart,” the elder lectured, pausing now and then to not so gently nudge a disciple back into proper position.\r\n\r\n“At this low stage of cultivation, you may suffer torn muscles, broken bones, and other minor injuries.”\r\n\r\nOne of the boys on the elder’s left collapsed mid-movement, his leg giving out beneath him. The elder waved the boy off to cool down.\r\n\r\n“The repercussions for failure only grow with your cultivation. You do not wish to make such mistakes when you begin reinforcement of the major organs.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi gritted her teeth as the muscles in her back cried out from being extended for so long.\r\n\r\n“One’s foundation of understanding is vital to cultivation. This is the sole reason that Elders such as I are spending our time teaching you.\r\n\r\n“The key to physical cultivation is Unity!” His voice boomed out over the field, and another person collapsed in a heap.\r\n\r\n“The body requires Unity and Balance.” Even in her current state, Ling Qi could hear the odd emphasis that he put on those words.\r\n\r\n“Flesh, bone, muscle, blood, the organs major and minor. No part of the body functions well without the others supporting it! And so all must be cultivated to achieve true strength.”\r\n\r\nHe rounded the end of the row and began to walk down the one occupied by Ling Qi.\r\n\r\n“The same can be said for the Sect and the Empire. No province would find the same prosperity or the same safety on its own.” Ling Qi’s breath hitched as she felt her body begging to be allowed to collapse.\r\n\r\n“No soldier survives a battle on his own. He survives with the support of his squad, which survives with the support of its battalion. A General without his men is no better than a head without a body. An army without a general is no better than a body without a head!\r\n\r\n“But all the same, cultivation is also about removing the impurities from the body. It is about ejecting weakness.” He stopped a scant dozen steps from Ling Qi’s position to survey the field, towering over the hunched and bent students.\r\n\r\n“I have said it before; I am not here to train court cultivators, who sit in their clan homes and play the games of politics. I train the soldiers who will stand as the bulwark of the Empire. This is your warning. In two weeks, the lessons I give freely will end.”\r\n\r\nMurmurs of alarm sounded at that, but none dared anything more.\r\n\r\n“The week after next, I will oversee a test. It will not be one that solely tests personal strength. You will be organized into squads and set against one another in various tasks. I intend to accept no more than thirty disciples into the remaining lessons.”\r\n\r\nHe resumed walking then, and Ling Qi bit her lip as she concentrated on not falling. Not now. She didn’t want to fail just as the Elder walked by…\r\n\r\nAs the Elder moved toward her, she let out a breath and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nNo. She would not let herself fail.\r\n\r\nShe felt her qi blaze in her dantian and resonate with the Argent Soul Art, the steady outward flow dispersing into her bones and muscles briefly increased and dulled the ache of exhaustion. When she opened her eyes, she found herself meeting the instructor’s eyes, if only for a second, as he swept his gaze over her.\r\n\r\n“We will see which of you has the potential to be worth more of my time then.\r\n\r\n“At ease, disciples,” Elder Zhou said as he reached the end of the line.\r\n\r\n“Perform your cooldowns and go. Prepare yourselves well.”\r\n\r\nThe tension in the air as he left the field was palpable. Ling Qi eyed her fellow disciples with new wariness. Their competition was no longer implicit. In two weeks time, they would be enemies.\r\n\r\nLing Qi left the day’s lessons in a daze. With this new deadline hanging over her head, all of her progress seemed paltry. It wasn’t fair. How was she supposed to compete in something like this when she had only just begun?\r\n\r\nShe reminded herself that life was not fair and had never been fair. She would just have to find a way to succeed.\r\n\r\nIt was a group exercise at least, and Elder Zhou had never said that it would be direct combat. Perhaps she could group with Meizhen? It felt unpleasant to have to rely on someone else’s strength, but pride was a luxury of the strong.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the wake of Instructor Zhou’s announcement, Ling Qi had been tempted to discard her current plans for cultivating the Argent Soul Art in favor of spending more time on the Zephyr’s Breath Art. In the end, she decided against it. Had the instructor not said that the foundation was the most important? Right now, the Argent Soul was her foundation so she would improve it no matter what.\r\n\r\nShe did come much closer to canceling her meeting with Li Suyin. However, she had already set the date, and there was no point in alienating one of her tiny handful of friendly contacts. Certainly not for a few hours of fumbling solo cultivation.\r\n\r\nSo unlike most days, instead of ducking out the moment Elder Su opened the door, she hung back. She watched Li Suyin carefully pack up the various writing tools the girl always brought to the lessons.\r\n\r\nLing Qi had started paying attention to the other girl since the day Li Suyin had approached her. The girl never seemed to be without her implements and carried them in an expensive looking case at her side. It was the only real proof that the girl had any wealth.\r\n\r\nLing Qi could see the appeal of taking notes. More than once, she had wished she could better recall Elder Su’s instruction even with her improved memory. Sadly, such things were laughably out of her reach financially. And while she could read, her writing ability was far too slow to keep up with the Elder’s lecture.\r\n\r\nWhen Li Suyin finally noticed her looking, her eyes widened momentarily before she hurried up, the shiny wooden case holding her notes and implements clutched against her chest.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry! Were you waiting for me? It’s just - I needed to blot the ink and -”\r\n\r\n“It’s fine,” Ling Qi cut her off a bit rudely. There was already attention being directed at the two of them, and this wasn’t the place for idle chatter.\r\n\r\n“Let’s walk while we talk,” she added, turning away to head for the door.\r\n\r\nShe heard Li Suyin murmur a response and hurry to catch up with her. Apologizing as she moved around and between other students.\r\n\r\n“W-why are you always in such a hurry to leave class?” the blue-haired girl asked as she finally fell in beside Ling Qi. Li Suyin was even shorter than Bai Meizhen, the other girl’s head barely came up to Ling Qi’s chest. Just another reason to feel awkward and out of place.\r\n\r\n“I like staying in practice,” Ling Qi responded. “The truce the Elders put down will only last less than two and a half months longer, and I am not popular.” Left unsaid was that Ling Qi didn’t have any family reputation to act as a buffer either.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, um…” The answer seemed to have surprised Li Suyin.\r\n\r\n“I… surely no one will do anything excessive, right?” At Ling Qi’s incredulous look, the shorter girl hurried on. “I mean, there will be… duels and such obviously, but we are all disciples of the same sect.”\r\n\r\n“... Maybe,” Ling Qi allowed, but she doubted it would be so civilized. If one dumped a few scraps of meat into a pen of starving dogs, they wouldn’t nicely share it either, and in her view, that was a pretty close approximation of the trickle of resources supplied to the outer disciples.\r\n\r\n“What’s the plan?”\r\n\r\nLi Suyin blinked at the sudden change in subject as the two of them hurried out of the lecture building.\r\n\r\n“I was thinking that you could come to my home, and I could ask you a few questions before observing you while you cultivate,” Li Suyin responded nervously. “I… I have been told my senses are quite good. It is hard to discern anything in the lecture hall when there is so much interference,” she said while gesturing vaguely to the other disciples around the two of them.\r\n\r\nWas Ling Qi getting set up for a trap? Even if Li Suyin seemed genuine, she didn’t like putting herself in the other girl’s space.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t we do it at my place instead?” Ling Qi asked challengingly to see how the other girl would respond.\r\n\r\nThe blue-haired girl’s eyes widened almost comically, and Li Suyin hunched her shoulders. “I… I’m not sure…. Would your housemate really allow that?” she asked, reminding Ling Qi of a frightened rabbit.\r\n\r\n“It’s my home too,” Ling Qi responded stubbornly. She honestly wasn’t sure how Meizhen would react to someone else in their home.\r\n\r\n“Besides, why is everyone so afraid or disdainful of Bai Meizhen?”\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Li Suyin was the one looking at her incredulously. “She… does her aura not affect you?” Li Suyin asked before frowning.\r\n\r\n“No, it must not. How else would you live in the same home,” Li Suyin mumbled to herself. “Is it just acclimation though or…”\r\n\r\nLing Qi shifted uncomfortably. Her heart still sped up sometimes when she was startled by Bai Meizhen’s presence, but it was mostly something that she had almost forgotten about given her constant proximity to the girl.\r\n\r\n“It can’t just be that,” Ling Qi said, cutting off the other girl’s inquisitive mumbling. “I mean- it’s a little unnerving, but we’re all cultivators here.”\r\n\r\nLi Suyin grimaced slightly, turning her attention back to Ling Qi.\r\n\r\n“I do not fully understand the matter myself… Father is only a regional minister of finance and was elevated in the exams. I’m not - not really a noble,” Li Suyin admitted uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n“The Bai family is… They frighten people and upset things with their disagreements with the Imperial Court. There are only a handful of ancient bloodlines left in the Empire, you know?”\r\n\r\nLing Qi didn’t know, but she supposed she would have to take the other girl’s word for it.\r\n\r\n“...We’ll do this at your place then,” she decided. In the end, her instincts told her Li Suyin wasn’t leading her on. She supposed it was a poor idea to invite someone over without asking Bai Meizhen. Her housemate could be prickly at the best of times.\r\n\r\nLing Qi followed Li Suyin to her home, a tiny stone hut on the edge of the residential area. It was… cramped. A single room with a hearth in the center and thin pallets laid out on either side.\r\n\r\nOne side clearly belonged to Li Suyin. It was neatly made and surrounded by paper and books. The other side was a mess of balled up blankets and discarded clothing, as well as a few other random knick knacks: a battered belt knife, a few stone dishes, and implements for grinding and mixing herbs. There were also fine, silky strands of hair on everything. Did the girl Li Suyin was rooming with have a cat or a dog?\r\n\r\nIn any case, Li Suyin mumbled apologies for the mess her housemate left and ushered Ling Qi into the only other room, which was essentially the equivalent of the meditation room at Ling Qi’s home but… downsized.\r\n\r\nOnce the two were seated in the dim and cramped room, things started off simple enough. Li Suyin asked various questions about Ling Qi’s cultivation and how Ling Qi felt while performing different exercises. Li Suyin scribbled down the answers on the paper spread across the wooden board she had laid out across her lap.\r\n\r\nLing Qi found herself relaxing as time passed and nothing untoward happened even as the other girl’s questions grew increasingly difficult. Things like the number of qi circulations in each ‘push’ on her meridian or the exact number of breaths she took per minute when meditating… Ling Qi couldn’t answer many of them since she didn’t really pay attention to such issues herself. It was frustrating to be unable to answer again and again.\r\n\r\n“Does any of this actually matter?” Ling Qi finally asked, cutting off Li Suyin’s latest inquiry about whether Ling Qi circulated her qi clockwise or counterclockwise or some mix of both when clearing her meridian.\r\n\r\nThe other girl paused in writing and shifted uncomfortably where she was seated only a short distance away.\r\n\r\n“I… don’t know,” Li Suyin admitted.\r\n\r\n“I ask questions in the lessons, but there is never enough time for everything I want to ask,” she added with a hint of frustration. “There is just so much that I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Why ask me then?” Ling Qi asked, leaning back against the wall. “There are probably other girls who actually know these answers.”\r\n\r\nLi Suyin looked aside, twiddling nervously with her ink brush. “But would they answer me?” she asked, expression bitter.\r\n\r\n“At least you are willing to sit down and answer questions instead of calling me foolish.”\r\n\r\n“That’s… fair,” Ling Qi admitted.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that I’ll be able to do this often. I need to cultivate, and the Argent Soul isn’t going to master itself.” Ling Qi didn’t dislike the other girl, but she was also finding it difficult to think of reasons why she should continue.\r\n\r\nLi Suyin’s face fell, but then her expression settled into one of determination. “Would - would you care for a look at my notes? I’ve done a fair amount of work on studying how the Argent Soul art works, as well as deciphering the meanings behind the koans and more opaque instructions.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi frowned but eventually nodded. She was already here, and it couldn’t hurt.\r\n\r\nLi Suyin’s notes were densely packed, but at the same time… they were pretty insightful. Li Suyin had ideas for achieving the improved qi generation of the second stage of the Argent Soul art that Ling Qi hadn\'t even considered.\r\n\r\nNow that Ling Qi had been presented with them, it made all too much sense. With the new insight in mind, she barely gave Li Suyin a thought before closing her eyes to cultivate. If Li Suyin was right about the last step of the second stage, then it was more than worth a little observation from Li Suyin.\r\n\r\nWhen Ling Qi opened her eyes, the sun had fallen beneath the the horizon. She felt incredibly refreshed. She could not yet maintain the second stage with any stability, but she had advanced in leaps and bounds compared to the muddled attempts she had made previously on her own.\r\n\r\nShe still jerked back in shock at the first sight she saw. Li Suyin had leaned in far closer than Ling Qi was comfortable with, hands hovering a hair’s breadth over Ling Qi’s stomach. Just how out of touch was Ling Qi when cultivating?\r\n\r\n“Back up,” Ling Qi commanded in a voice that was definitely not an embarrassed yelp.\r\n\r\nLi Suyin startled at the sound of Ling Qi’s voice and flushed a deep red when she met Ling Qi’s eyes. Li Suyin hastily jerked back with wide eyes as her hands flew up to cover her mouth.\r\n\r\n“I - I’m sorry!” Li Suyin squeaked out. “I just lost track of things while observing your qi and I think I’ve nearly managed to open the meridian in my arm and I got better results when I was closer and...” she rambled defensively.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Just - just don’t do that again,” Ling Qi interrupted shakily. She didn’t care for having her personal space invaded.\r\n\r\n“... I don’t mind coming by again sometime,” Ling Qi said in the awkward silence that followed. “As long as you keep sharing your notes,” she added hastily.\r\n\r\nLing Qi couldn’t but feel a little pleased at the bright smile that overtook the mousy girl’s expression. How long had it been since someone had been genuinely happy to see her?\r\n'),

It increased his nobility and majesty tenfold, and kept the rain off his feathers. It even imparted a portion of the beast’s sublime speed unto him.\r\n\r\nIt was most pleasing to his females.\r\n\r\nThe Great Master had also bought along new females, and two new potential disciples, or so he assumed. Chun Ke and Pi Pa were odd, hairless things that rooted around and squealed most displeasingly.\r\n\r\nBut the Great Master fed them his leftovers, and threw them the dried out nubs of Heavenly Herbs, so he stayed his spurs, and watched to see if they were worthy of ascending past their base forms.\r\n\r\nHis Lord had also redoubled his own efforts, and once more Bi De watched in awe. Trees fell, one after another, and were transformed into logs and planks. The rice was swiftly reaped, and then set out to dry, the fat heads of the foodstuff looking unbelievably tempting.\r\n\r\nBut now, The Great Master was acting with his overwhelming wisdom again, and he was lost.\r\n\r\nHis master built great fires, and did place selected stone within them. The fires burned hotter than any before, and when the great master was done, they were white and brittle. From there, he made them into power, and added water, clay, and rocks to produce an odd sludge, which he moulded and poured into the shapes he desired.\r\n\r\nThe next day, when he examined them, he was enlightened.\r\n\r\nHis Great Master had made liquid stone. Truly, his Great Master’s intellect surpassed all others!\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nI breathe out.\r\n\r\nEven with qi, my concrete was shit. I would need to do some more testing with ratios. I know mostly how this is supposed to work, so if I keep trucking at it, I‘ll probably succeed eventually.\r\n\r\nUntil then, it looks like we’re starting with stone. I’m going to try and get the new house finished before the snow hits…. But that probably not happening. I know these things always take longer than you think they will, and I’ve worked on a couple of houses in the Before. Foundation is a definite, though.\r\n\r\nI sigh contentedly, and sit down, putting my feet into the water of the stream. Big D joins me, and shouts “Cock-a-doodle-doo!”\r\n\r\n“You tell ‘em, Big D.” I mutter, and start scratching my guard chicken’s head. Like a guard dog, but meaner.\r\n\r\nThe thought takes me. I grin, get up, and get a plank of wood, a chisel, and some ash.\r\n\r\nHeh. Hehheh. This is going to confuse visitors so much.\r\n\r\nI place my work proudly on the Fence’s gate, and then go for dinner.\r\n\r\nFish tonight, from the river, with Spirit Herb and asparagus.\r\n\r\nDelicious. Peppa and Chunky get the leftovers.\r\n\r\nI crawl into bed feeling that good kind of exhausted, and breathe in contentedly.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\n“As quoted by witnesses, the travelling cultivator declared that it was impossible for such weak cultivators to be a part of the mighty Shrouded Mountain sect, much less a Young Master of it.”\r\n\r\nJian Li Wei’s face was stony as he studied the mortal before him. His rage was a quiet thing, gently bubbling beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nTo be called upon by mortals, claiming that they had captured someone with the gall to declare that they were a part of his sect?\r\n\r\nHe glared at Third Brother Zeng’s youngest, Zang Li, chained as he was in suppression seals. He would say nothing for now. To lose the Shrouded Mountain Sect face like this, this little brat dared?\r\n\r\nAt least he had the sense to keep his damn fool mouth shut, and not compound his failures.\r\n\r\n“We thank the Verdant Hill for so swiftly informing us of this egregious plot against our Shrouded Mountain sect.” He said, lying through his teeth. “We shall take these…imposters elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nThe mortal bowed his head. “We release them to you, then.”\r\n\r\nLi Wei gave the pathetic boy a once over as he was unchained from the suppression seals. His lightning qi was intact. The Wandering Expert who had defeated him had shown remarkable restraint.\r\n\r\nThey departed.\r\n\r\n“Before you even open your mouth, you brat, I will not be fighting your battles for you. You have shamed yourself.” Li Wei snarled at the boy. Zang Li looked appropriately contrite, if slightly ill. It severed the little bastard right. “Get revenge on your own, or look away from this matter, on your own. Either way, you will be returning to the Shrouded Mountain.”\r\n\r\n“I apologise, Uncle.” The little shit mumbled.\r\n\r\nInternally, Lu Ban was sweating, and concentrating his hardest on stabilising his technique while the expert carried him like a sack, purposefully making the journey uncomfortable. It had been hard enough under the suppression seals, but he was a dragon destined for the heavens.\r\n\r\nOn a cursory glance, his qi was that of lightning.\r\n\r\nUnderneath, oil and blood bubbled.\r\n\r\nHe let out a breath. The Twilight Cuckoo’s Triumph settled.\r\n\r\nHis plan was at fruition, though faster than he thought would happen. Now, he would have the resources of the Shrouded Mountain, as he originally intended when he slew the young master and devoured him. He might have gotten a bit carried away while stabilising his technique, feasting upon his lessers, but now…\r\n\r\nLu Ban swore, in the safety of his own mind, that he would slaughter all those who stood before him.\r\n\r\nThis “Jin” would pay dearly for his near exposure.

('First Steps 1', 'Forge of Destiny', 5, '\r\n\r\nLing Qi began her first morning as a disciple of the Sect blearily rummaging through the tiny kitchen for something simple to eat. She was quite happy that they had stocked up the previous night; she would hate to have to trudge out to the storehouse before she had a chance to properly wake up.\r\n\r\nHonestly, it still felt a little bizarre to think that she no longer had to worry about where her food would come from. Her musings served as ample distraction while she finished preparing breakfast. She was a bit surprised to note that Meizhen’s door was still closed, and there was no sign of the other girl waking up yet. Ling Qi hadn’t really read the girl as being the type to sleep in like this.\r\n\r\nA quick glance out the window as she sat down to eat showed that it was a good hour past sunrise. Even after she had finished eating and gone back to her room to make a futile effort at taming her hair and cleaning up for the day ahead, her roommate’s door remained closed. Ling Qi considered knocking, or even cracking the door open to check on her, but the other girl’s warning lingered in her mind.\r\n\r\nInstead, she decided to spend her morning continuing to work on the exercises given for the Argent Soul technique until it was closer to noon. Sitting cross legged in the darkened meditation room simply breathing was oddly relaxing once she had managed to still her thoughts, and Ling Qi quickly found her tiredness fading.\r\n\r\nWithout using a spirit stone, she didn’t feel any increase in the fragile flicker of warmth remaining from last night’s meditation, but it still felt good to sense it ‘breathing’ along with her. For the first time in recent memory, she felt like she was genuinely good at something. She knew it was probably just wishful thinking on her part, but she allowed the thought to linger anyway.\r\n\r\nWhen she emerged from the meditation room, she found that Bai Meizhen had finally awakened. The girl was seated by the hearth sipping from a cup of water, looking just as immaculate as she had the day before. Ling Qi felt a twinge of jealousy at the seeming ease with which the other girl maintained her appearance. She had long since resigned herself to her own peculiarities.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the pale girl was different in one major way; the snake she had seen hints of was now fully visible, looped loosely around Bai Meizhen’s neck. It was an eye catching thing with bright green scales that reminded her of expensive jade. It was also quite small, only being about as wide as two fingers held together.\r\n\r\nThe snake and girl looked up with eerie synchronicity as Ling Qi emerged, and she couldn’t help but notice that the little snake’s eyes were the exact same shade as Meizhen’s. Before the silence could become awkward, Ling Qi looked back up to her roommate’s face.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’re up then. Good morning.” She didn’t feel the need to try and speak better around the other girl, who seemed to have no reaction to it either way.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” Bai Meizhen responded evenly, not breaking eye contact… or blinking. Ling Qi really wished she would blink more often. “Did your cultivation go well?”\r\n\r\nLing Qi shrugged, feeling a bit self conscious. She liked to think so, but she had nothing to compare it too. “I think so. I mean… I don’t think I managed to ‘awaken’ but I think I can feel something in my ‘dantian’ now?” Ling Qi stumbled over her words more than she would have liked.\r\n\r\nThe pale girl simply nodded slightly in response, setting down her now empty cup. “That is expected. It would be highly unusual for you to have broken through to the Red Soul stage in a single night of cultivation without significantly greater resources.” She reached up to idly stroke the tiny spade shaped head of her serpent with one finger as she spoke and the reptile pressed itself against her touch.\r\n\r\n“I cannot imagine you will fail to achieve it by the end of the week should you put the effort in,” she added. Her tone was as bland as ever, but Ling Qi thought she was going for encouraging. Maybe. She also might be putting an ultimatum down; it was hard to tell.\r\n\r\nDespite that, Ling Qi had a feeling that this girl’s views on natural progression speeds might be a bit skewed. “I know I’ll manage it,” she responded with more confidence than she actually felt. “I have to go out though so I’ll see you later.” She’d like to ask more about some of the things the other girl touched on, but she’d be late if she did.\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen responded with a small nod as Ling Qi turned to go, turning her full attention back to the serpent around her neck. The last sight she had of them was the bright green snake raising its head and hissing in Bai Meizhen’s ear, almost as if whispering to her.\r\n\r\nIt was a clear, bright day, though the autumn chill was quite strong. Ling Qi was relieved to find that her disciple’s uniform was warm despite the fact that it was hardly winter wear. It really was the nicest set of clothing she had ever owned. She still wanted to modify it a bit, if only because of the poor fit. Perhaps she could see about breaking in the sewing kit she had been provided.\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts were kept to the back of her head as most of Ling Qi’s focus was on ensuring that she didn’t run across trouble on the way to the plaza. She didn’t know if her ‘friendship’ with Bai Meizhen would be enough to invite real reprisal, but she didn’t feel the need to take chances.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith no one actively looking for her and the lack of real crowds, it wasn’t difficult to simply take a circuitous route to the edge of the area. Once there, she skirted around the perimeter until she reached the entrance path carved into the mountainside. She kept her head down and slouched subtly to hide her height, making it out without trouble.\r\n\r\n It would get harder as time went on, but for now, her little tricks for avoiding notice were sufficient. Luckily, there were few people on the path to the plaza, and those that were traveling it were fairly scattered and too occupied with their own thoughts to pay her any mind. The plaza itself was more populated, and it was here that she first saw older disciples. There were even more of them than students her own age. Where had they come from?\r\n\r\nShe stuck to the edge of the plaza for a time to observe but eventually relaxed. None of the older disciples seemed to have any interest in those from her group. In fact, they seemed to be almost pointedly ignoring them as they went about their business. Most headed into the large lecture building, but others simply stood around in groups chatting or heading off down the other…\r\n\r\nThose hadn’t been there yesterday. There were now four other gates - two on the eastern side and two on the western side - marking paths that wound up or down the mountain. Ling Qi shook her head at the sight. More magic. She really was out of her league. The confidence she had felt last night and this morning was ebbing quickly. Eventually, she moved out of the shade of the gates and begin searching for Han Jian.\r\n\r\nShe knew it was foolish, but between her embarrassment with Sun Liling and her roommate’s… taciturn nature, she really was looking forward to some simple, friendly interaction. She couldn’t really bring herself to be suspicious of the handsome boy.\r\n\r\nThis was the only reason she paused rather than leave entirely when she caught sight of him already having a conversation with another disciple. It was another boy, shorter by a head than the two of them, but significantly broader at the shoulder and wider at the waist. If anything, he seemed almost Han Jian’s opposite: squat and brawny with fierce features and spiky black hair.\r\n\r\nShe wasn’t close enough to hear them over the low murmur of sound from the rest of the plaza, but she did see that the shorter boy was doing most of the talking, gesturing wildly. He seemed to have a rather bombastic personality at first glance.\r\n\r\nHan Jian’s smile seemed pretty fixed. Han Jian met her eyes then, noticing her where she had stopped in the shade of one of the scattered peach trees. For an instant, Ling Qi saw something like relief in his eyes. That was enough to get her moving again. Once she had gotten closer, Han Jian raised a hand, interrupting the other boy.\r\n\r\n“Ling Qi! Over here! Glad you could make it.” That was one way to excuse oneself from a conversation though she wasn’t too pleased about the attention it drew to her. For his part, the shorter boy turned quickly in the direction of Han Jian’s gaze, an eager expression on his face… only for it to fade as soon as his eyes landed on her.\r\n\r\nLing Qi suppressed her frown and instead nodded politely to Han Jian as she closed the distance.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Han Jian. I’m sorry if I was late.” With him, she felt she should at least make an effort at politeness.  \r\n\r\nLing Qi glanced at his companion. He was frowning unhappily at her. What was his problem? “Who might your-”\r\n\r\n“Really, Jian?” the shorter boy interrupted, giving the other boy an incredulous look. “When I heard a heartbreaker like you was coming out to meet a girl, I thought I would have a chance to meet a beauty, not a stick with pretensions!”\r\n\r\nHis words were loud and coarse, even discounting their content. Ling Qi felt her expression freeze on her face even as Han Jian winced almost imperceptibly. If she hadn’t already noticed his discomfort with the other boy, she might have done or said something unfortunate. As it was, she held back, but only just, by clenching her teeth. In the silence that followed, Han Jian managed to rally.\r\n\r\n“...Yu, isn’t that a bit much? There’s no call to be rude to another practitioner. Besides, I told you that it wasn’t anything like that.”\r\n\r\n“That was definitely more than a bit much,” Ling Qi interjected sourly, glaring at the shorter boy, and ignoring the unpleasant twinge that Han Jian’s words brought for no reason that she would acknowledge.\r\n\r\n‘Yu’ simply waved a dismissive hand at her words, making her temper flare further. He didn’t even look at her. “She’s just a commoner, Jian. You can tell by looking. Are you really going to waste time on this?”\r\n\r\nLing Qi didn’t bother saying anything this time though her expression grew darker. She couldn’t do anything about this now, but she would certainly remember the insult. Han Jian’s expression was wary as he responded.\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to break a promise, Yu.” It was probably the least friendly thing she had ever heard him say.\r\n\r\nThe shorter boy snorted in response. “Fine. I suppose I won’t begrudge you your tastes, Jian. Just try not to waste too much time. I won’t stand for a brother of mine falling behind!” He stomped off on his own as his words faded into the morning air, leaving the two of them standing in awkward silence. Well, Han Jian seemed awkward. Ling Qi was seething internally.\r\n\r\n“So… brother?” she asked dully, fixing Han Jian with an unimpressed expression.\r\n\r\nHe winced, rubbing the back of his neck with his hand. It was only then that she noticed the tiger cub was nowhere to be seen. “Not by blood. It’s just…” he trailed off, seemingly searching for words. “Have you ever had a peer that your parents pretty much ordered you to make nice with? It’s like that.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi hadn’t ever had that experience, but she could understand what he meant. She had ‘made nice’ with less pleasant people during her time living in the streets. She felt her temper cooling. It wasn’t Han Jian’s fault.\r\n\r\n“Heartbreaker?” She quirked an eyebrow.\r\n\r\nNow, the handsome boy just looked tired and exasperated.\r\n\r\n“It’s a stupid joke that started a few years back because of a friend’s sisters. Yu just takes it too seriously because...” He trailed off and gestured helplessly at his handsome face. \r\n\r\nLing Qi thought he sounded sincere, but she couldn’t help but be a bit more wary now. Although if she were being more reasonable, it was a little silly for a fourteen year old boy to be considered a ‘heartbreaker’. “So, what happens now?”\r\n\r\nHe sighed. “I can give you a few tips on starting your cultivation, and if you would like, and I can help you practice a bit like I said I would,” he responded sincerely. “I’ll be going to the classes the Elders are holding in the afternoon though.”\r\n\r\n“So will I,” Ling Qi said, feeling a bit relieved. “Will this be a one time thing then?”\r\n\r\n“I figure I can spare an hour or two every few days if you’d like.” Han Jian really did seem almost too nice. His ass of a friend did have a point though. She was just a commoner; why was he willing to spend time on her? She would like the answer to be that he simply liked her, but she wasn’t sure she could believe that.\r\n\r\n“I would like that.” Linq Qi considered just asking him, but she couldn’t risk offending him and losing his aid. She needed every resource she could get right now. She felt a little sad that the encounter with the other boy had made her suspicious, but it was for the best.\r\n\r\n“Where should we start?” she asked. “My roommate helped me get a feel for my dantian, and I think I have the first breathing exercise down.”\r\n\r\n“Oh? That was fast,” Han Jian said, eyebrows rising. “I assume you mean the Argent Soul exercises,” he continued, to which she nodded. “I’ll leave finishing that to the Elder later. If you understand your dantian…”\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure I do,” Ling Qi admitted. “She kind of… brute forced it. I get that it’s your spiritual center and where you store qi, but…” She trailed off, spreading her hands in a gesture of helplessness.\r\n\r\nHe gave her strange look, leaning back against the trunk of the peach tree they were standing under.\r\n\r\n“...Right, that is the gist of it. The dantian’s not a physical organ like your heart or your stomach, but exercising and expanding it is at the core of improving your ability to hold and use qi. Think of it as the heart of your spirit.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi was aware vaguely of the body’s organs, from a half remembered diagram in a physician’s text that she had stolen and pawned off last year. She wracked her thoughts for information from a text she had only flipped through in a moment of idleness while waiting for a fence.\r\n\r\n“Does that mean that once I awaken it, it will start moving qi through the rest of my body?”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and despite herself, she felt a little warmer.\r\n\r\n“Yeah. But unlike your physical veins, you will have to open your meridians manually. It’s... pretty difficult and painful, but you’ll need to bear with it because your qi won’t be able to affect the world without any open channels.”\r\n\r\nCultivation wasn’t easy it seemed. Ling Qi took a seat on the bench beneath the tree as they continued to talk, discussing the basics of cultivation.\r\n\r\nThere were a very large number of potential meridians in the human body and which ones she chose to open would affect which techniques and arts she could learn. Arts were what cultivators called their magic, and techniques were individual spells within an art. Much of it went over her head, but she thought she understood the basic idea.\r\n\r\nHan Jian had wind-aligned meridians open in his legs, as well as fire-aligned meridians through his heart and spine. A practitioner essentially had a limited amount of space in their body to use for channeling qi, which allowed the use of arts. A meridian could only channel a single type of qi at a time, limiting the number of arts a cultivator could use. As one grew in power, their body could withstand the opening of more meridians, allowing them a greater breadth of techniques.\r\n\r\nIt did mean that Ling Qi, who was just starting out, would be limited to a single art at first. That was troubling. If the classes turned up nothing on the matter, she might have to ask Bai Meizhen for advice.\r\n\r\nFor all that she did enjoy the time she spent with Han Jian, it couldn’t last forever. After an hour or so, she had a slightly better handle on things, and he had corrected some mistakes she was making with the Argent Soul exercises. It was with somewhat restored confidence that she walked alongside him to the lecture hall as the sun dipped past its zenith and the time for the afternoon lessons began.\r\n');

('First Steps 2', 'Forge of Destiny', 6, '\r\n\r\nThe lecture hall was much busier than it had been yesterday. The large board which had held the welcoming banner was now covered with notices written on its polished surface. Even as Han Jian and Ling Qi searched the board for the information on the Elders’ lessons, some notices vanished while others seemed to write themselves. It was an impressive bit of magic.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the two Elders who had made themselves available had scheduled their lessons such that it was impossible to attend both on the same day. It was a bit frustrating to Ling Qi, but she supposed they must have a reason for it.\r\n\r\nFor now, she chose to head to the spiritual cultivation course. Han Jian had mentioned during their chat that physical cultivation could not be properly started until a potential cultivator’s qi had been unlocked. Presumably, the spiritual lesson would teach her how to unlock her qi.\r\n\r\nThe lecture hall they were directed to had perhaps thirty students in it, a far cry than the number in the one she had entered on her first day. Another difference made itself apparent when a sharp female voice stopped her dead in the doorway.\r\n\r\n“Unawakened disciples on the left. Awakened on the right.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed the instructor was already here. The Elder was a short woman with gray hair done up in a simple and utilitarian bun. She stood behind the lecturer’s podium with her arms crossed over her chest, a no nonsense expression on her severe features. Her tone brooked no disagreement so Ling Qi split from Han Jian there with the boy mouthing a silent ‘good luck’ to her as they did. She appreciated the sentiment as she found a seat with her back to the wall and no immediate neighbors.\r\n\r\nOnce she was settled in, she studied the instructor. The Elder’s appearance was a bit strange. She seemed like an old woman in demeanor, and her barked orders and severe expression would fit right in with the elderly women from her hometown. Yet, despite her grey hair, her face had an ageless quality to it - not unlined, but certainly not old either - and her full figured body did not give the impression of being withered with age.\r\n\r\nConsidering what stories she had heard about Immortals, that would make sense, she supposed. It was a bit exciting to see proof of the slowed aging that awaited her with success as a cultivator.\r\n\r\nA few more students trickled in over the next few minutes until at last, the matronly elder made a sharp gesture with her right hand and the door snapped shut.\r\n\r\n“Consider this my first lesson. Lateness will not be tolerated,” she said crisply, sweeping the room with an intimidating stare. “If you are late, you will not receive my instruction that day. There will be no exceptions. Nor will I allow interruptions. Any purposeful disruption of my lesson will result in your immediate expulsion from this room. You will not be allowed back.”\r\n\r\nThe few whispers and sounds from the students presented ended immediately. The Elder regarded them silently for a beat. “Good. You can follow instructions,” she said with a small amount of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“I am Elder Hua Su. I am the Head of our Medicinal department. You will refer to me as Elder Su, Physician Su, or Instructor, and nothing else. You are here because you have had no instruction in the spiritual arts for whatever reason.” There was no judgement in the Elder’s words, only a statement of fact.\r\n\r\n“Or because you desire expert advice in setting your foundation. In that case, I applaud your humility. All cultivation is rooted in the spiritual. One cannot begin to improve the body with qi before that qi itself is unlocked, and the concepts necessary for all cultivation are by their nature, ephemeral.” Ling Qi leaned forward slightly in her seat, not wanting to miss a single word.\r\n\r\n“But before we begin, it would be best to split the class as I Intended.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi blinked in confusion as the Elder flicked her wrist, drawing forth a silver needle and pricking the thumb of her opposite hand. She didn’t understand what the older woman was doing until the bright droplet of blood that fell from her thumb swelled and grew on its way to the floor. It shifted through a kaleidoscope of colors as it did and seemed to pull in heat from the room going by the sudden chill. Within seconds, an identical copy of the Elder stood at her side.\r\n\r\n“And now, to avoid distraction.”\r\n\r\nIt was odd hearing two identical people speak in perfect unison as both raised their left hands and gestured again. The room filled with cloying mist which quickly congealed into a barrier right through the center of the room that blocked Ling Qi’s sight of the other side. It also left them once again with only one instructor. The original, she thought, though she wasn’t certain.\r\n\r\n“Qi is the root of a cultivator’s power,” Elder Su began immediately, easily pulling Ling Qi’s attention back to her.\r\n\r\n“When you awaken it, you will begin the path to shucking mortal concerns. Food, drink, sleep... All of these can be replaced with qi given sufficient cultivation,” she said evenly, panning her gaze over those left in their half of the room. “And a good thing it is. Walking the path of cultivation does not afford us the time to spend on such things every day.”\r\n\r\n“That is not to say that mortal pleasures should be abandoned entirely,” she continued. “That is a common misconception and a foolish one. Your qi is colored and shaped by your experiences and personality. Those who abandon everything in the pursuit of power will find their path to be a narrow one indeed.” Her lip curled slightly, a display of contempt that seemed out of place on the woman’s stern face.\r\n\r\n“Of course, such narrowness does not mean a lack of power, and I expect some of you will fall to the temptation.”\r\n\r\nShe paused then as a thin girl with light blue hair raised a trembling hand near the front of the room. Ling Qi was surprised at the girl’s boldness. Elder Su regarded the girl silently for several moments, but the girl’s hand did not lower. The Elder’s stern expression cracked and she smiled. “Yes? What is your question?”\r\n\r\nThe girl lowered her hand, the line of her back shoulders suggesting startlement.\r\n\r\n“Ah… I just wondered if you could expand on what you meant? I never - I mean - Your instruction is… different than what I have heard before,” the girl stammered.\r\n\r\n“What is your name, girl?” Elder Su asked neutrally\r\n\r\nThe girl shifted uncomfortably but answered. “Li Suyin, Instructor.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” Elder Su responded thoughtfully. “I had intended to expand on the point regardless, but as Miss Li has shown, I am willing to allow questions… should you not be disruptive in the asking.\r\n\r\n“There are distinct elements to qi and how easily one can channel a given type is largely dependant on the individual and their mindset. It is all too easy to say that a clear and emotionless mind is for the best as it provides a fair baseline for many elements, but one loses something in this practice.\r\n\r\n“Heaven, lake, fire, thunder, wind, water, mountain, and earth... These are but a few of the many aspects qi can conform to. Each element is associated with several concepts, emotions, and effects.\r\n\r\n“Those who devote themselves to the well being of others find the qi of the earth flowing more easily. Forget joy or pleasure, and your lake qi will grow sluggish. “Such things are beyond the scope of this introductory lesson. Should you wish to learn more, I strongly suggest you continue attending,” she said sternly.\r\n\r\n“More importantly, those who forget the mortal world entirely too often hole themselves up in caves. This does no good for anyone; hermits are hardly a boon to the Empire.” There was a touch of humor in Elder Su’s voice, but while Ling Qi laughed politely along with the others, she had the feeling there was more to the older woman’s words than the light explanation given.\r\n\r\n“Now, more relevant to newcomers are the stages of cultivation. All of you are, in effect, still mortals although I see that some of you have begun to awaken your qi.” Ling Qi fidgeted in her seat as the instructor’s gaze briefly rested on her.\r\n\r\n“The first stage of spiritual cultivation is the Red Soul realm. This realm is then divided into early, middle, and late stages. The next two realms beyond are the Yellow and Green realms. For most cultivators, the Green realm is the limit of what they can achieve. Advancing beyond it requires a great deal of talent and dedication, as well as significant physical cultivation to survive the strain such large amounts of qi put on the body.”\r\n\r\nThe lesson went on like that with the older woman helping greatly in expanding Ling Qi’s understanding of just what she was doing when she filled her dantian and how to more efficiently guide the energy from a spirit stone to her dantian.\r\n\r\nWith her eyes closed and concentrating on her internal energy, Ling Qi could almost feel what she thought were her meridians. It was as if her dantian had dozens of veins branching out from it, but every single one was clogged by... something. The weak energy within her couldn’t even begin to shift the blockage in the meridians.\r\n\r\nShe still felt refreshed, her energy bolstered, by the time the lesson let out. She felt thoughtful as she returned to the little stone home she shared with Bai Meizhen and settled in to cultivate for the evening. Thinking of how much of the previous stone she had wasted turned her stomach.\r\n\r\nThis time, when she clasped the stone in her hands and closed her eyes, she settled her breathing into the correct pattern and drew only tiny threads of the stone’s warm natural qi with each breath to trickle into her slowly filling dantian. Time faded away until only the flickering warmth in her hands, her breathing, and the growing seed of power within her existed.\r\n\r\nHer candle burned out and Ling Qi did not notice.\r\n\r\nThe sun set and Ling Qi did not notice.\r\n\r\nThe moment she broke through, Ling Qi did notice.\r\n\r\nAs the energy circulating within her dantian pulsed unaided for the first time, everything changed. Her breath was the wind, her bones were the earth, her blood was fire, and she felt like her thoughts could expand to cover the heavens.\r\n\r\nShe felt complete like she never had before. Her dantian burned with energy, and although the stubborn obstructions prevented her from drawing the energy out, the warmth and comfort she felt from simply having it was all too real.\r\n\r\nThen the exhaustion hit, a bone deep tiredness that nearly made her fall asleep where she sat as her dantian hungrily drew on her body’s energy. She staggered to bed and blacked out.\r\n'),
('First Steps 3', 'Forge of Destiny', 7, '\r\n\r\nLinq Qi awoke the next morning feeling full of energy despite her exhaustion the night before. She did need a change of clothing as she had fallen asleep in her uniform. She had a few additional sets so she didn’t have to worry about laundry just yet. She would have to find a place to bathe soon though.\r\n\r\n...Was it strange to be concerned about something so mundane when she had just taken her first step into the world of Immortals? Ling Qi thought so, but hadn’t Elder Su said yesterday that neglecting mortal concerns entirely was a bad idea? Ling Qi finished changing and left her room. Bai Meizhen was awake and already seated cross-legged by the hearth, sipping from a cup of water again. There was no sign of a breakfast tray or any other food.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, Ling Qi had never actually seen Bai Meizhen eat. Perhaps the other girl was using her qi to suppress her appetite? Elder Su had explained that it was possible to expend qi to suppress or even satisfy the body’s need for food and water. Ling Qi didn’t think she could manage to do so for very long yet. She didn’t want to stand there staring so she stepped out and nodded to the girl.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” she greeted cautiously.\r\n\r\nBoth Meizhen and her pet looked up in unison, and the pale girl dipped her head in response. “Good morning, and congratulations on your awakening. I take it your lesson was fruitful?”\r\n\r\nLing Qi seated herself across from the other girl. “It was. I guess you didn’t need the lesson? I didn’t see you there,” Ling Qi responded, idly smoothing the fabric of her uniform as she got comfortable.\r\n\r\n“I attended Instructor Zhou’s lesson,” Bai Meizhen said calmly. “It was… intense, but I feel I benefited from it.” The little snake coiled loosely around Meizhen’s neck twisted its head to look up at its owner, flicking its tongue out several times. Bai Meizhen glanced at it with a slight frown.\r\n\r\nZhou… that was the name of the instructor for physical cultivation, Ling Qi recalled.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know if it’s rude to ask but… what stage are you at?” Ling Qi asked after a few moments of companionable silence. The question had occurred to her later in Elder Su’s lesson, and it hadn’t quite left her mind.\r\n\r\n“Second Sin Shedding,” Bai Meizhen immediately answered. She must have noticed Ling Qi’s confusion because an expression of chagrin crossed her face. “... Middle Yellow stage spirit cultivation,” she amended. “I am not yet used to using the… standardized terms.”\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen was very far ahead then. Ling Qi was a little discouraged to know she was so far behind.\r\n\r\n“Are most of the other disciples that advanced?” Ling Qi asked, somewhat dreading the answer. “And what do you mean by standardized?”\r\n\r\n“No. Those in the Yellow stage can be counted on the fingers of one hand,” the pale girl responded dismissively. “Most of our peers are no higher than the middle of the Red Soul Stage.\r\n\r\n“Old families such as mine have their own traditions and terms for cultivation. The terms disciples are taught to use here are only a handful of millenia old. The standard terms were coined during the establishment of the current imperial dynasty.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi nodded, feeling relieved that she wasn’t trailing quite as far behind as she had feared. Her roommate was simply… unusual. It seemed strange that someone as strong as her would be ostracized. She would think that everyone would want to be friends with the most powerful people. She didn’t want to press the other girl for information on something that might be personal though.\r\n\r\n“Is that why you came here with a spirit beast already?” Ling Qi asked, searching for a thread to keep the conversation going. She could sense the qi in the little snake now. “I’ve seen a couple others who have them too. Do your families give them out?”\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen frowned harshly at her, and the snake’s head twitched toward her as well, leaving Ling Qi subject to two baleful and unblinking stares. What did she say? After a moment, the other girl sighed, glanced at her pet, and made a brief, soft hissing sound, reaching up to stroke the serpent’s bright green scales.\r\n\r\n“I will forgive the insinuation since you are not aware. It is partially my fault as well for not introducing her properly.” Bai Meizhen fixed Ling Qi with a serious look.\r\n\r\n“This is my cousin, Bai Cui. Please do not refer to her as if she was a pet.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi stared blankly at her.\r\n\r\n“How does that even -t - She’s a snake. How is she your cousin?” Ling Qi asked incredulously.\r\n\r\nThe snake - Cui, Ling Qi reminded herself - hissed softly in what could almost be mistaken for laughter.\r\n\r\n“I know it is not an approved practice anymore, but really, how can you not know such things?” Bai Meizhen huffed in annoyance. “She is my cousin because our Sublime Ancestor is the White Serpent of Lake Hei. We are from two branches of the same family.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi closed her eyes, trying very hard not to picture the… mechanics of such an arrangement. Did that mean that Han Jian too… she couldn\'t help but picture the tall boy with a pair of fuzzy cat ears atop his head.\r\n\r\n“I… right, sorry?” Ling Qi eventually managed. “You just don’t really hear about that kind of thing in the little city I came from,” she finished a touch lamely.\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen simply nodded, not appearing to hold it against her.\r\n\r\n“I think,” Bai Meizhen began slowly, “I should attempt to educate you on a few matters if only to ensure you do not offend someone unintentionally in the future.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi blinked in surprise, even as she felt a hint of dread at having to learn a bunch of information not even related to her cultivation. Still, she had been intending to spend time with the other girl this week. Despite her unsettling presence, Bai Meizhen had already helped Ling Qi once.\r\n\r\n“That could be useful,” Ling Qi hedged. “What did you have in mind?” Ling Qi did not have the luxury of being choosy when it came to friendly contacts.\r\n\r\n“Nothing complex,” the other girl assured her. “Just a bit of history and some knowledge about the nobility. Enough to prevent you from making a fool of yourself.” Ling Qi did not trust the way Cui appeared to be doing the serpentine equivalent of laughing aloud.\r\n\r\n“That sounds fine…” she responded despite her better judgement.\r\n\r\nReally, how bad could it be?\r\n\r\nQuite bad, she thought gloomily as she trudged across the plaza to her first lesson on physical cultivation. Bai Meizhen was not a gifted teacher. Her diction was dry, and her dispassionate tone made it all too easy to nod off. Still, she couldn’t say the information was useless. Despite the dryness of the lessons, Ling Qi found herself remembering most of it, which was strange. She had never been particularly great at academic learning before.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was a side effect of her awakening? Her thoughts had felt clearer since she had broken through, and it felt much easier to recall information. She could ask Elder Su tomorrow. For now, she had a lesson to get to and she had no intention of being late.\r\n\r\nOnce again, she was walking alone. Bai Meizhen had declined to come along, citing the need to perform some kind of personal meditation. Ling Qi slipped through the crowds with practiced ease and soon found herself on a new path. It spiralled up the east side of the mountain and ended on a smaller plateau with a number of wide fields divided by posts and rope barriers. Each field was equipped with racks full of practice weapons, weights, and other equipment reminiscent of the guardsmen’s drilling yard back home writ large.\r\n\r\nShe saw various older disciples scattered about, performing exercises, running, and other slightly incomprehensible things. Was that boy balancing himself on the point of one finger? Why? Shaking her head, she hurried past to the field at the end where a crowd of disciples her age were waiting. There, she saw the boy with the burn scar she had noticed the first day, as well as that loathsome ‘Yu’ fellow.\r\n\r\nPeering into the morning fog as she got closer, she searched for the instructor. She saw the silhouette of a taller figure standing beyond the crowd. She stopped dead as she got a good look at him. The first thought and indeed the only thought that came to Ling Qi was… muscles. The man standing with his arms clasped behind his back was shirtless and looked like he had been carved from a block of solid bronze. His biceps were easily as thick as another man’s thighs, and she had no idea that it was even possible to have that many clearly defined abdominal muscles.\r\n\r\nLing Qi flushed scarlet and averted her eyes when she noticed that she had been staring in a rather undignified manner at her instructor. Luckily, no one seemed to have noticed her losing her composure. When she looked back, she focused on his face. He looked as she would expect: stern expression, a wide square jaw, and short, evenly cropped hair tied back in a top knot. Still feeling slightly ashamed of her initial break in composure, Ling Qi did her best to fade into the crowd and not draw attention to herself until the lesson started.\r\n\r\nShe did not have to wait too long. Only a few other students filtered in to join the murmuring crowd standing before the utterly silent instructor. She might have thought the man a statue were it not for the rise and fall of his chest. She wasn’t staring. She wasn’t.\r\n\r\nThen he spoke, and the disciples quieted immediately.\r\n\r\n“Those who were here yesterday. Begin running.” His voice held an authoritative tone that brooked no argument and set Ling Qi’s instincts on edge. A good two thirds of the students immediately began to move away, toward the well beaten dirt track around the edge of the field.\r\n\r\n“Those of you who remain,” he continued without once looking their way. “I expect your full effort for the length of every session. Disciples consistently giving less than that in tasks I assign will be expelled from the lesson. I will not provide second chances.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi was feeling a bit of deja vu at the similarity to the other Elder’s speech.\r\n\r\n“I will not mince words. I am only here at the direct request of Master Yuan, the Sect Head. Most of you will never serve in my unit on the border. Most of you do not have the resolve to be a part of the Empire’s Bulwark. I train those who act as the wall which keeps the Cloud Tribes from our towns and cities. A single failure of attention can bring ruin to entire settlements.\r\n\r\n“I am not in the habit of training those who only intend to be here long enough to gain some piddling strength to establish themselves in court or clan.”\r\n\r\nSeveral disciples shifted on their feet, and Ling Qi saw some angry and indignant expressions, as well as worry and other emotions. The Instructor pushed on, as implacable as a glacier.\r\n\r\n“I am Zhou the Indomitable, commander of the Sect military, and for some reason, the Sect Head thinks you have the potential to be taught by me,” he barked, voice carrying over the field. “I expect most of you will disappoint him.”\r\n\r\nOne or two of the crowd were looking rather mutinous, but Ling Qi noticed that those who had been here the day before had their eyes firmly fixed ahead, not reacting to his words as they ran. She caught a mutter from one of the boys in front of her, one of a handful of young men standing in a loose group near that bastard Yu.\r\n\r\nOf course, if she heard it, she was not surprised that the Elder heard it as well.\r\n\r\n“Repeat what you just said, boy,” the instructor commanded, moving for the first time to point an accusing finger at the speaker. The boy immediately went pale, looking around for support only to find his companions conspicuously turning their faces away. He swallowed, but seemed to find his spine a moment later.\r\n\r\n“I said… I said that fighting nomads was not so impressive,” he said miserably. “They are just… just barbarians, you know. Any decent imperial soldier should be able to crush them.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so,” Zhou responded blandly. Pivoting on one foot, he reached over to a nearby weapon rack and tossed one of the blunted practice spears on it at the boy. To his credit, the boy caught it with barely a fumble.\r\n\r\n“You have a mid-gold rank physique. As I understand it, that is roughly average for most interior cities’ guard officers. Correct?”\r\n\r\nThe boy nodded with a hint of pride.\r\n\r\n“Very well. Strike me.”\r\n\r\nThe boy blinked. “Sir…?”\r\n\r\n“Did I stutter, boy?” Zhou asked coldly, taking a step forward. “I said: strike me. Strike as if you were trying to kill.” The boy continued to hesitate and Elder Zhou took another step forward.\r\n\r\n“Strike. Now. Or I will have you expelled from the sect.”\r\n\r\nThat seemed to break the boy’s hesitation, and he stabbed forward toward the instructor’s throat. It appeared like a skilled strike to Ling Qi’s inexperienced eye. Zhou made no effort to dodge, stepping forward to meet it. The iron tip of the spear struck against Instructor Zhou’s neck and bent for an instant before the pressure snapped the wood haft, and the instructor’s hand swept out in a blur.\r\n\r\nThe next thing she knew, the boy was rolling across the field a half dozen feet away, whimpering and clutching a rapidly swelling cheek. Zhou looked as impassive as ever as he withdrew his extended hand.\r\n\r\n“I did not use my qi in any active way,” he explained clinically. “Nor did I strike with even a fraction of my strength.” He fixed a glare on each of them in turn as he continued.\r\n\r\n“I have met several nomad Khans who could match me in combat. I have met more still who could at least put up a fight. To underestimate the Empire’s enemies is to invite death to our people. Am I understood?”\r\n\r\nLing Qi found herself nodding, along with the other disciples present. Not a single one hesitated when he commanded them to run and to not stop until he commanded it. What followed were the most miserable and grueling hours of exertion that Ling Qi could recall. Instructor Zhou was utterly without pity for any of them, but at the same time, he seemed to have a preternatural sense for when they genuinely couldn’t be pushed any further.\r\n\r\nThose that had reached their limits with more conventional exercise were set to meditating under his watch, while being instructed to… ‘diffuse’ their qi throughout their bodies. This would allow the qi to soak into their flesh and bones rather than gathering in their dantian. They were to practice the qi exercises until the instructor decided they had recovered enough to resume the more physical exercises.\r\n\r\nUnlike her earlier efforts at cultivation, Ling Qi felt that her progress was quite slow. She could definitely feel something happening, but it was frustrating feeling most of the qi she attempted to diffuse simply wasting away into the air. Her mood wasn’t helped by the soreness of her muscles as she trudged back home for the evening. Yet despite her exhaustion, Ling Qi found herself feeling a bit of wonder.\r\n\r\nBy cycling her qi according to the freshly mastered first stage of the Argent Soul Art, she had been able to run faster and longer than she could have managed even just days ago. When she stumbled and fell, her qi flared instinctively to shield her palms against the scrapes she would have normally received. If she was already capable of this after only two days of cultivation, just what wonders would the future hold?\r\n'),
('First Steps 4', 'Forge of Destiny', 8, '\r\n\r\nIt was very easy to fall into a routine. Wake up, cultivate, share a few words with Meizhen, attend lessons, and spend time with Han Jian here and there. After just a week, it felt like she had been doing this forever.\r\n\r\nHer newfound ability to retain information really was a boon. She could not imagine actually remembering most of the minutiae Bai Meizhen discussed with her or the dense lectures of Elder Su without the clarity of thought cultivation had brought her. She shouldn’t have been surprised; Immortals were supposed to be superior to mortals in every way.\r\n\r\nHer rapid awakening had actually brought a brief smile to the strict Elder Su’s lips. It was the first time in years that Ling Qi had felt genuinely proud of herself.\r\n\r\nNow Awakened, she was able to join the other half of the class. Han Jian was a great help in getting her through the material she had missed; most of it was an expansion on what he had been teaching her in their brief meetings.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the spiritual class was focused on the opening of meridians.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure I understand,” Ling Qi admitted. “What exactly is an impurity?” she asked Han Jian as they rested on the bench beneath one of the plaza’s trees after a lesson. Despite her earlier resolve, she still lacked the confidence to ask questions in the lesson itself.\r\n\r\n“You could probably debate a scholar about that for weeks,” Han Jian said with a chuckle. “Basically, it’s all the toxins and impure materials that poison our bodies and spirits. We’re born with them, and they only get worse with age. Everything in the world has impurities in it, but the closer you come to the peak of cultivation, the less you have.”\r\n\r\nThat explained why she felt like she had been crawling through a sewer pipe after a long afternoon trying to work a meridian open, Ling Qi thought sourly.\r\n\r\n“So meridians are actually in the body?” She asked. “Because last week, we learned that our dantians were wholly spiritual.”\r\n\r\n“Your meridians are what bring your qi into the physical world so they exist both physically and spiritually. But you can’t physically interact with the channels themselves except with the aid of certain arts or talismans. Where you carve the channels in your body also decides what type of energies they can carry.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that makes sense.” Ling Qi sighed.\r\n\r\nAs they parted ways, his words echoed in her thoughts. Ling Qi had advanced to the point where she would have to choose what kind of meridian to work on opening, and that would affect what arts she would be able to use at first.\r\n\r\nMeridians were defined by the part of the body their exit points manifested in. Meridians in the legs were primarily used for movement techniques, while arm meridians were best for energy projection and techniques focused on direct harm. Spinal meridians were primarily used for techniques which enhanced or modified the self, and the heart meridians were best used for techniques which created various effects in a field around the user.\r\n\r\nOne could also open meridians which emerged from the head and affected the senses or those from the throat, which were associated with the lungs, and allowed the creation of qi constructs. However, Elder Su had warned the disciples that head or lung meridians were poor choices for their first because a misstep in opening those could cause major harm.\r\n\r\nIt was just one more concern among the others that were piling up.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven with her quick advancement, Ling Qi was still among the weakest people on the mountain. She had never really been strong, but in her home town, that hadn’t mattered much. There were enough people that she could always slip away and vanish into a crowd, and few people - aside from the owner - really cared if several loaves of bread or a bag of rice went missing. Here, there was just over a thousand people on the outer sect mountain.\r\n\r\nOnly one resource, the spirit stones, mattered. Ling Qi herself was beginning to feel the pinch of their limited supply. True, if she didn’t foolishly glut on the energy held within like she had the first night, a single stone could provide for a week of cultivation… but she knew instinctively that she could advance faster with a greater supply. More than once, she had found herself considering if she could acquire more, at her peers expense.\r\n\r\nOf course, she wouldn’t consider doing that to Bai Meizhen. Despite the taciturn girl’s ‘friendliness’ toward her, there was always a feeling of danger around the other girl. No, she wouldn’t even dare to place herself within Bai Meizhen’s personal space without a direct invitation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the other girls she passed on her circuitous route out of the residential area were sloppy and inattentive in the same way that the wealthier inhabitants of her home town could be. She was fairly certain she could filch from them without being noticed.\r\n\r\nHowever, it wasn’t a step she wanted to take without thought. If she did get caught, the consequences would probably be unpleasant. At the very least, it would earn her a bad reputation, and her standing wasn’t exactly very high to begin with.\r\n\r\nHer standing was something else that did little for her mood. Even here, she was mostly sneered at and ignored by so-called peers; only Han Jian and Bai Meizhen treated her politely. It was beginning to bother her in a way that she had a hard time articulating.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose thoughts returned to her again the next day as she sat beside Han Jian in the plaza gardens. She had been working on stabilizing her cultivation, smoothing out the few imbalances that her rapid growth had left in her energy.\r\n\r\nAs the two of them meditated under the eaves of one of the entry plaza’s scattered trees, she found her thoughts bubbling with a simple question. Why was he doing this? She couldn’t really offer him anything, and yet he was helping her anyway. It was suspicious. He hadn’t even alluded to her owing him, which only increased her wariness.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe glanced over at where he sat cross-legged in the grass, hands on his knees and eyes closed. The tiger cub Heijin was with him today although the lazy feline was asleep in his lap as Heijin was most times they did this. Finally, she could stand her own distraction no more.\r\n\r\n“Why are you still meeting me?” Her voice broke the tranquil silence. She wasn’t good at subtlety when it came to this kind of thing. “I appreciate the help, but it doesn’t make sense.”\r\n\r\nHer words pulled Han Jian out of his mediation, and he cracked open an eye to regard her curiously. “What brought this on?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen you around. You never lack someone to talk to or to partner with in exercises,” Ling Qi responded, doing her best to avoid sounding accusatory. “You have higher cultivation than me as well. So - why are you helping me?”\r\n\r\nShe didn’t exactly stalk him, but she had… hung around after their meetings a few times and kept a surreptitious eye on him during lessons. It seemed Han Jian knew many people, and most of them were if not friendly, then at least accepting of his presence.\r\n\r\nHe relaxed from his stiff mediation and leaned back against the tree trunk behind him.\r\n\r\n“Do I need a reason?” he asked lightly, reaching down to scratch Heijin behind the ears. “You aren’t totally unpleasant to be around, you know?” he added with a hint of teasing.\r\n\r\nLing Qi frowned, watching him out of the corner of his eye. There was something slightly off about his expression.\r\n\r\n“No one does something without a reason,” she replied stubbornly. “I know I am not… popular, and I lack the power to make up for that. Spending time with me must degrade your own reputation too.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi saw a flicker of something angry in Han Jian’s expression, a crack in his friendly demeanor, but it disappeared too fast for her to be sure she had even seen it.\r\n\r\n“I think you’re underestimating yourself. You broke through to the first stage in less than a week. That earned you some positive attention,” he said. Ling Qi didn’t miss the deflection in his words. “Besides, everyone can use a little down time, you know?”\r\n\r\nShe considered his words for a few moments. “So, I’m an excuse to get away from others?” She might not be the best at social interactions, but she liked to think she was reasonably perceptive.\r\n\r\nHe sighed, glancing up at the sky. “Don’t read too much into things, Ling Qi,” he responded tiredly. “It doesn’t do any good to get hung up on the little stuff.”\r\n\r\nHe was right on that much, and she was better than this. She hadn’t lived as long as she had by moping about silly things even if she wished that he had said that he enjoyed spending time with her.\r\n\r\n“Right,” she said, not quite agreeing but unwilling to argue with him over it. “Ah, I had almost forgotten. There was something I wanted to ask you about that Instructor Zhou seemed to leave out of his lectures.”\r\n\r\nHan Jian smiled, relaxing now that she had changed the subject. “What’s that? He’s pretty thorough.”\r\n\r\n“He never explained what the levels of physical cultivation are,” Ling Qi responded with a frown. “There was some mention of a Gold rank, but I don’t know what that means.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I suppose that makes sense. He probably mentioned it the first day and simply didn’t bother repeating it the second,” Han Jian responded reasonably, eyeing Heijin as the tiger cub bounded off of his lap to chase after a passing butterfly.\r\n\r\n“The progression is Gold, Silver, and then Bronze. There are realms after Bronze but like the spiritual realms after Green, we don’t need to worry about that for awhile.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that backward? Why is Gold the lowest realm?”\r\n\r\n“Let me see if I can remember how my tutor put it,” Han Jian said, humming thoughtfully to himself.\r\n\r\n“Gold is a malleable metal, easily shaped, just like a young cultivator. Yet it is also soft and easily damaged.” He put on a slightly mocking ‘serious’ voice as he recited the words, causing Ling Qi to smile slightly.\r\n\r\nReturning to his normal voice, he added, “It’s also the least valuable metal for Immortals. It isn’t particularly good for talismans, and accumulating a mortal fortune is pretty trivial for any Immortal with decent skills. It just isn’t important to us in the same way as it is for mortals.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi nodded thoughtfully, her smile fading. It made sense she supposed. She still couldn’t see herself turning down a pile of gold coins. She had other things she needed to ask though.\r\n\r\n“Thank you. On another note, would you mind if I asked you for advice on clearing a heart meridian as well? Now that I’ve reached the first stage, I want to be able to actually use my qi.”\r\n\r\nSurprised, Han Jian raised an eyebrow. “You’re going for heart? Most people go for an arm or the spine for the first meridian.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi gave him an unsure look. “Is there something wrong with opening the heart first? You have heart meridians open too.”\r\n\r\n“Well yeah, but I’m expected to lead,” he responded easily, wincing as Heijin returned to nip at his fingers. He glared down at the kitten before continuing.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t take you for the leader type.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi hunched her shoulders a bit. She didn’t really feel like she was a leader either, but she was not going to catch up in raw strength any time soon. Increasing her value as a support-type would make it easier to keep Bai Meizhen’s goodwill - or some other group’s if it came down to it.\r\n\r\n“I have my reasons,” she responded stubbornly.\r\n\r\nHan Jian regarded her quietly for a moment but then shrugged slightly. “Well, alright. First thing to keep in mind is that you need to time the qi pulses to your heartbeat. If you don’t, you’ll risk making your heart seize up. The more precise the timing, the better off you’ll be…”\r\n\r\nLing Qi leaned forward, listening intently. She would do this, and she wouldn’t fail.\r\n');

('First Steps 5', 'Forge of Destiny', 9, '\r\n\r\nLing Qi’s next few days were marred by long periods of exhausting meditation interspersed with frightening brushes with mortality when control of her qi slipped and sent her heart beating erratically. Carving open a channel for her qi was a painstaking task.\r\n\r\nCompleting it meant that she could begin learning to attune it to an element and practice the simplest arts. Time spent in lessons and in private cultivation blurred together as she focused on her goal.\r\n\r\nHer breakthrough finally came during the last of Elder Su’s lessons that week. With the lecture over, the class was allowed to cultivate under the Elder’s watchful eye. In her seat at the back of the room, Ling Qi slowed her breathing and continued to push her qi through the slowly opening spiritual channel.\r\n\r\nAt first, things proceeded as normal, her qi pulsing in time with her heartbeat. Suddenly, her breathing hitched as she felt something within her crumble. With no more spiritual detritus blocking its way, her qi gushed outward. Engrossed in the sudden feeling of soaring freedom, she was only vaguely aware of startled gasps and the sound of rushing wind from around her.\r\n\r\nLing Qi opened her eyes, blinking in wonder at the new feelings. She suddenly felt so… aware. She could feel the smooth material of her uniform on her skin and the tiny motions of the air around her. She could hear the sound of rustling cloth as the person on her right side shifted away from her and her own clothes flapping in an invisible breeze.\r\n\r\n“Please settle yourself, Disciple Qi.”\r\n\r\nShe was startled from her contemplation by the sudden presence of Elder Su in the aisle to her left. Even with her new awareness, she hadn’t been able to feel the Elder approaching. Her cheeks coloring slightly at the mild reprimand, she did her best to follow the instruction, trying to reign in the flow of her qi. The phantom breeze weakened but did not die as she worked to regain control.\r\n\r\nThe Elder continued up the steps of the aisle, stopping as she came to stand beside Ling Qi’s seat.\r\n\r\n“It seems your natural qi has a tinge of wind to it,” the older woman said quietly. In the silence of the room, her words rang out clearly. “Do you require a moment outside to compose yourself?”\r\n\r\nLing Qi felt uncomfortable as she felt the attention of the other disciples settle on her. At the same time, she felt pride from the fact that Elder Su was addressing her directly and unprompted at that.\r\n\r\n“No, Elder Su.”\r\n\r\nThe matronly woman fixed Ling Qi with a gaze that seemed to peer through her.\r\n\r\n“I see. You have been doing quite well so far.” The older woman flicked her sleeve, and Ling Qi blinked as an odd jade token appeared on the desk in front of her.\r\n\r\n“Take this to the archive. The supervisor there will allow you to take a copy of one of the arts from the first floor.”\r\n\r\nArchive? She had no idea where that was. She had no idea there even was an archive, but Elder Su was already moving away. She didn’t want to make herself appear foolish by having to ask so she remained silent. As pleased as she was to be given this, she was well aware that any chance she had of muddling along beneath notice had just vanished.\r\n\r\n“Thank you Elder,” she managed to say, lowering her head in respect, even as she carefully hid away the jade token she had been given. It looked mundane, but she wasn’t about to risk losing it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of lesson proceeded normally. Ling Qi used her remaining time to practice getting used to the feeling of qi flowing through her open meridian. As Ling Qi hurried to disappear into the crowd of disciples leaving the lessons, she was brought up short.\r\n\r\n“Ah… Miss Ling! Miss Ling, can you please wait a moment?” An out of breath female voice called from behind her.\r\n\r\nLing Qi glanced behind herself warily and slowed down. She had made it out to the plaza and there were many people around so it was unlikely that someone was going to try something. What she saw when she turned her head was a girl she recognized from her lessons with Elder Su. Li Suyin, if she recalled correctly.\r\n\r\nLi Suyin had long, light blue hair and the sort of slim, petite figure that most of the female disciples did. She was rather plain though, much like Ling Qi herself. The girl lacked the obvious cosmetics or accessories that the wealthier girls used to show off, but Li Suyin was still too pale and unblemished to be a commoner.\r\n\r\nShe was also red faced from exertion. It looked like she had run to catch up with Ling Qi, and she didn’t seem very fit physically.\r\n\r\n“What do you need?” Ling Qi asked. The other girl had never been rude to her or jostled her in the halls so she could afford to be polite.\r\n\r\nThe other girl seemed relieved that Ling Qi had stopped. “I am glad I caught you today. You always disappear so quickly after lessons,” Li Suyin said between breaths, smoothing her gown nervously with her hands. “I… well. I was hoping you might consider helping me?”\r\n\r\nLing Qi stared at her. What could Li Suyin want help with? The other girl had awakened earlier this week so Ling Qi wasn’t exactly far ahead of her.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how I could help,” Ling Qi replied bluntly.\r\n\r\nLi Suyin fidgeted under her gaze. “W-well... You have advanced so quickly. It took me a month to reach this point. I was hoping that we could discuss the differences in our methods, and that I could observe your cultivation in private.” Her voice seemed to get smaller and smaller as she went on. By the end, Li Suyin wasn’t even looking her in the eye anymore.\r\n\r\n“...I’m sorry. I’m aware that that is a very rude request.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi felt awkward about being asked for help. She was also more than a little suspicious. She couldn’t imagine that she would be much help to the other girl either.\r\n\r\n“I’ll think about it,” she said. “Give me a few days to consider.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” the other girl said hurriedly. “Um - well, if you want to, we can meet after lessons.” She glanced back up at Ling Qi’s skeptical face for a moment before her shoulders slumped a little. “I will… stop bothering you. It’s obvious that you are very busy.”\r\n\r\nLi Suyin began to hurry away, leaving Ling Qi to wonder if the girl’s nerves were truly genuine. It didn’t feel like a deception. She couldn’t see herself benefitting from the discussions either, but… her thoughts returned to Han Jian, where the situation was reversed.\r\n\r\n“Li Suyin,” she called out. “I’ll make some time in a few days, alright?”\r\n\r\nThe nervous girl, having stopped at her call, beamed at her, offering a hasty but grateful bow. “Thank you very much!”\r\n\r\nWhen Ling Qi returned home, she was surprised to see the light of a lit hearth in the window. Bai Meizhen kept erratic hours. Sometimes, Ling Qi would never even see her arrive at their shared home in the evening.\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen also had strange habits. Ling Qi had never once seen the girl eat a single grain of rice or so much as sip from a bowl of soup for example. Even when Ling Qi offered to share her meals, they were refused.\r\n\r\n...She had seen the other girl with a trickle of blood on her chin on one late morning, but Bai Meizhen had wiped it away moments after meeting Ling Qi’s stare. Ling Qi had not felt brave enough to ask about it given the other girl’s frosty expression.\r\n\r\nOddities aside, Bai Meizhen was… helpful in her taciturn and condescending way. As Ling Qi settled in for the evening and finished her simple dinner, she ended up speaking with the girl, resuming their ‘lessons’ on the boring minutiae of noble etiquette.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m still not really sure I understand, but… are you saying all noble families have a ‘Sublime Ancestor’? Is that some kind of tradition? That someone has to… marry a spirit to make their line noble?” Ling Qi’s expression was strange as she tried to parse Bai Meizhen’s explanation on how ranking and position among noble clans worked.\r\n\r\n“All of the truly well-established families have or had such a non-human ancestor. Only an exalted few can claim to have a Sublime Ancestor,” the pale girl explained with a hint of impatience.\r\n\r\n“I do not understand why you have such trouble with the idea,” Bai Meizhen added irritably. “A few Sublime Ancestors have died or disappeared, but this should still be common knowledge. The relationship between a powerful cultivator and their bound spirits has always been close.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi had found that Bai Meizhen had strange ideas on what constituted common knowledge.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by bound spirits?” Ling Qi asked, eyeing the green scales visible just under the neckline of Bai Meizhen’s gown. “Is that why Cui seems like she shares your qi?” She still wasn’t very good at feeling other people’s energy but she was around the two of them often enough to feel the oddity.\r\n\r\n“When a cultivator reaches the second stratum… the Yellow realm, it becomes possible to bond with a spirit whether beast or pure. This serves to strengthen both parties, allowing them to cultivate together and share growth to a degree. It also serves to humanize the spirit, making it easier for the spirit to interact with and understand us.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi nodded thoughtfully, reaching out to warm her hands at the hearth. It was beginning to get cold in the evenings. She didn’t follow everything Bai Meizhen had just said, but the gist was simple.\r\n\r\n“Oh. So he’s at that point…” she murmured to herself, thinking about Han Jian. She hadn’t thought he was that advanced.\r\n\r\n“That boy is not yet bonded with his familial partner,” Bai Meizhen’s voice shook her out of her contemplation. “He yet remains at the peak of the Red realm.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi blinked, turning back to Meizhen. “How did you know who I was thinking of?”\r\n\r\nThe other girl’s unsettling gaze slipped to the side. The silence quickly became awkward.\r\n\r\n“... I have observed you with him once. It seemed obvious who you were thinking of,” Bai Meizhen replied eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, it wasn’t like she had cause to complain. She had done some shadowing too.\r\n\r\n“Right… Anyway, you were telling me about how noble families rank against each other? Is it just who has the strongest ancestors or is it determined by Heavenly Mandate like the Imperial Seat?” She might be an uneducated peasant but even she was aware of some things.\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen’s lips curled in disdain. “I forget sometimes the prevalence of imperial propaganda,” she muttered more to herself than Ling Qi.\r\n\r\n“The clan holding the Imperial Seat is chosen by who can hold it against their rivals. The current dynasty\'s hold is maintained by their control of the supply of spirit stones in the great mines of Mount Tai, as well as the web of alliances the mines have given them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLing Qi’s eyes widened at the casual and disdainful description. It was uncomfortable to hear someone speak of the Imperial throne that way. It just… wasn’t done.\r\n\r\n“But… doesn’t the Dragon Throne incinerate false claimants?” There were all sorts of stories of wicked schemers destroyed for daring to touch the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” Bai Meizhen responded, her irritation showing in the sibilant undertone that colored her words. “However, the first emperor and creator of the throne was a very promiscuous man. Almost every noble family of any pedigree is descended from him.”\r\n\r\nFeeling rather uncomfortable with the subject matter, Ling Qi soon changed it, but she now felt she had an inkling of why Meizhen might be isolated. Was her family out of favor with the Imperial Court?\r\n\r\nThe thought was unsettling enough to cut into her sleep that night.\r\n\r\nThis was very unhelpful the next day as she trudged toward the training grounds before sunrise for another lesson with Elder Zhou. If she were honest, these lessons were probably her least favorite times on the mountain. The man was a merciless taskmaster and every time she attended, she went home exhausted, sore, and filthy with sweat and dirt. She wasn’t afraid of getting dirty, but Ling Qi had never imagined she could be that tired.\r\n\r\nShe felt some pride in that she was one of only a score or so of the girls who regularly showed up and kept up. She saw Meizhen once or twice, as well as Sun Liling, both of whom were irritating in different ways. Meizhen because the snow white girl never seemed to tire properly and never sweated at all, no matter how hard she worked Sun Liling because whenever she showed up, she got the instructor’s personal attention.\r\n\r\nThere were no more incidents like the first day. No student spoke back or interrupted Instructor Zhou again, not even the boy still nursing a bruise from last week.\r\n\r\nTheir instructor spoke little. When he did, Zhou’s lectures were oddly mundane, in that he spoke little of cultivation matters but more on fitness. Actual exercise was needed alongside meditation to allow qi to properly seep into the muscles and bones, and he constantly reminded them that keeping their bodies in the peak of mundane health was necessary for laying the foundation of their physical cultivation.\r\n\r\nA cultivator’s body degraded slower than a mortal’s, much slower as they grew stronger. Once she reached the peak, it wouldn’t be difficult to stay there, but here, at the beginning, she could not afford to slack at all.\r\n\r\nNot that she intended to.\r\n\r\nLing Qi was all too aware of how much she would benefit from having an Immortal’s body. Sickness, disease, starvation. All the ugly things she had spent her life worrying about could be cast aside and forgotten if she just exercised hard enough. How could she not put her full effort into it?\r\n\r\nSo despite her difficulties, Ling Qi stubbornly pushed on with her cultivation, doing her utmost to focus her qi into her exhausted muscles during her periods of meditation. Today, despite its miserable beginnings, her cultivation paid off.\r\n\r\nIt happened as she was in the midst of a set of push ups, a cool down from the more intense exercises. It was as if she had been straining against a great weight tied to her back, only for it to suddenly vanish. Vitality flooded her tired limbs, banishing her fatigue and lingering tiredness like morning mist before the sun. Her body felt lighter than it ever had before, and aches she had forgotten she even had faded away.\r\n\r\n“Good. Get up and join the third group,” Ling Qi’s gaze snapped up as she found herself staring at the veritable mountain of muscle that was Instructor Zhou. How did Elders do that?\r\n\r\nHastily nodding, she stood, not trusting herself to respond without stuttering something embarrassing. No matter how harsh he was, the older man was very… distracting up close.\r\n\r\nMoving toward the group of students who had reached the Early Gold stage, she paused as Elder Zhou spoke again.\r\n\r\n“Do not slow down. You are still far behind your peers.”\r\n\r\nHis words stung but… they were true. Gritting her teeth in determination, Ling Qi set herself to driving her body to exhaustion once again.\r\n\r\nAfter Elder Zhou’s lesson, Ling Qi dragged her tired body up the narrow path which lead to the archive. She had learned its location by listening in on the other groups of disciples coming and going. Although her muscles ached and her lungs burned with exertion, she did not want to put this off any longer.\r\n\r\nShe wished the location was more convenient. The archive was a rounded tower rising from the top of a cliff, and the path she walked was a narrow switchback carved into the face of it, steep and dangerous. Even as tired as she was though, Ling Qi felt no concern. Though her limbs dragged, her balance was more perfect than ever.\r\n\r\nReaching the top, she took a moment to catch her breath and then proceeded forward. It took a moment for her to figure out the door. Apparently, she needed to slot the token Elder Su had given her into it, but once slotted, the door swung open, opening the archive to her.\r\n\r\nSoon, she would have an art of her own.\r\n'),
('Gestation 1', 'Worm', 1, 'Class ended in five minutes and all I could think was, an hour is too long for lunch.\r\n\r\nSince the start of the semester, I had been looking forward to the part of Mr. Gladly’s World Issues class where we’d start discussing capes.  Now that it had finally arrived, I couldn’t focus.  I fidgeted, my pen moving from hand to hand, tapping, or absently drawing some figure in the corner of the page to join the other doodles.  My eyes were restless too, darting from the clock above the door to Mr. Gladly and back to the clock.  I wasn’t picking up enough of his lesson to follow along.  Twenty minutes to twelve; five minutes left before class ended.\r\n\r\nHe was animated, clearly excited about what he was talking about, and for once, the class was listening.  He was the sort of teacher who tried to be friends with his students, the sort who went by “Mr. G” instead of Mr. Gladly.  He liked to end class a little earlier than usual and chat with the popular kids, gave lots of group work so others could hang out with their friends in class, and had ‘fun’ assignments like mock trials.\r\n\r\nHe struck me as one of the ‘popular’ kids who had become a teacher.  He probably thought he was everyone’s favorite.  I wondered how he’d react if he heard my opinion on the subject.  Would it shatter his self image or would he shrug it off as an anomaly from the gloomy girl that never spoke up in class?\r\n\r\nI glanced over my shoulder.  Madison Clements sat two rows to my left and two seats back.  She saw me looking and smirked, her eyes narrowing, and I lowered my eyes to my notebook.  I tried to ignore the ugly, sour feeling that stewed in my stomach.  I glanced up at the clock.  Eleven-forty-three.\r\n\r\n“Let me wrap up here,” Mr. Gladly said, “Sorry, guys, but there is homework for the weekend.  Think about capes and how they’ve impacted the world around you.  Make a list if you want, but it’s not mandatory.  On Monday we’ll break up into groups of four and see what group has the best list.  I’ll buy the winning group treats from the vending machine.”\r\n\r\nThere were a series of cheers, followed by the classroom devolving into noisy chaos.  The room was filled with sounds of binders snapping shut, textbooks and notebooks being slammed closed, chairs screeching on cheap tile and the dull roar of emerging conversation.  A bunch of the more social members of the class gathered around Mr. Gladly to chat.\r\n\r\nMe?  I just put my books away and kept quiet.  I’d written down almost nothing in the way of notes; there were collections of doodles spreading across the page and numbers in the margins where I’d counted down the minutes to lunch as if I was keeping track of the timer on a bomb.\r\n\r\nMadison was talking with her friends.  She was popular, but not gorgeous in the way the stereotypical popular girls on TV were.  She was ‘adorable’, instead.  Petite.  She played up the image with sky blue pins in her shoulder length brown hair and a cutesy attitude. Madison wore a strapless top and denim skirt, which seemed absolutely moronic to me given the fact that it was still early enough in the spring that we could see our breath in the mornings.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t exactly in a position to criticize her.  Boys liked her and she had friends, while the same was hardly true for me.  The only feminine feature I had going for me was my dark curly hair, which I’d grown long.  The clothes I wore didn’t show skin, and I didn’t deck myself out in bright colors like a bird showing off its plumage.\r\n\r\nGuys liked her, I think, because she was appealing without being intimidating.\r\n\r\nIf they only knew.\r\n\r\nThe bell rang with a lilting ding-dong, and I was the first one out the door.  I didn’t run, but I moved at a decent clip as I headed up the stairwell to the third floor and made my way to the girl’s washroom.\r\n\r\nThere were a half dozen girls there already, which meant I had to wait for a stall to open up.  I nervously watched the door of the bathroom, feeling my heart drop every time someone entered the room.\r\n\r\nAs soon as there was a free stall, I let myself in and locked the door.   I leaned against the wall and exhaled slowly.  It wasn’t quite a sigh of relief.  Relief implied you felt better.  I wouldn’t feel better until I got home.  No, I just felt less uneasy.\r\n\r\nIt took maybe five minutes before the noise of others in the washroom stopped.  A peek below the partitions showed that there was nobody else in the other stalls.  I sat on the lid of the toilet and got my brown bag lunch to begin eating.\r\n\r\nLunch on the toilet was routine now.  Every school day, I would finish off my brown bag lunch, then I’d do homework or read a book until lunch hour was over.  The only book in my bag that I hadn’t already read was called ‘Triumvirate’, a biography of the leading three members of the Protectorate.  I was thinking I would spend as long as I could on Mr. Gladly’s assignment before reading, because I wasn’t enjoying the book.  Biographies weren’t my thing, and they were especially not my thing when I was suspicious it was all made up.\r\n\r\nWhatever my plan, I didn’t even have a chance to finish my pita wrap.  The door of the bathroom banged open.  I froze.  I didn’t want to rustle the bag and clue anyone into what I was doing, so I kept still and listened.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t make out the voices.  The noise of the conversation was obscured by giggling and the sound of water from the sinks.  There was a knock on the door, making me jump.  I ignored it, but the person on the other side just repeated the knock.\r\n\r\n“Occupied,” I called out, hesitantly.\r\n\r\n“Oh my god, it’s Taylor!” one of the girls on the outside exclaimed with glee, then in response to something another girl whispered, I barely heard her add, “Yeah, do it!”\r\n\r\nI stood up abruptly, letting the brown bag with the last mouthful of my lunch fall to the tiled floor.  Rushing for the door, I popped the lock open and pushed.  The door didn’t budge.\r\n\r\nThere were noises from the stalls on either side of me, then a sound above me.  I looked up to see what it was, only to get splashed in the face.  My eyes started burning, and I was momentarily blinded by the stinging fluid in my eyes and my blurring of my glasses.  I could taste it as it ran down to my nose and mouth.  Cranberry juice.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t stop there.  I managed to pull my glasses off just in time to see Madison and Sophia leaning over the top of the stall, each of them with plastic bottles at the ready.  I bent over with my hands shielding my head just before they emptied the contents over me.\r\n\r\nIt ran down the back of my neck, soaked my clothes, fizzed as it ran through my hair.  I pushed against the door again, but the girl on the other side was braced against it with her body.\r\n\r\nIf the girls pouring juice and soda on me were Madison and Sophia, that meant the girl on the other side of the door was Emma, leader of the trio.  Feeling a flare of anger at the realization, I shoved on the door, the full weight of my body slamming against it.  I didn’t accomplish anything, and my shoes lost traction on the juice-slick floor.  I fell to my knees in the puddling juice.\r\n\r\nEmpty plastic bottles with labels for grape and cranberry juice fell to the ground around me.  A bottle of orange soda bounced off my shoulder to splash into the puddle before rolling under the partition and into the next stall.  The smell of the fruity drinks and sodas was sickly sweet.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open, and I glared up at the three girls.  Madison, Sophia and Emma.  Where Madison was cute, a late bloomer, Sophia and Emma were the types of girls that fit the ‘prom queen’ image.  Sophia was dark skinned, with a slender, athletic build she’d developed as a runner on the school track team.  Red-headed Emma, by contrast, had all the curves the guys wanted.  She was good looking enough to get occasional jobs as a amateur model for the catalogs that the local department stores and malls put out.  The three of them were laughing like it was the funniest thing in the world, but the sounds of their amusement barely registered with me.  My attention was on the faint roar of blood pumping in my ears and an urgent, ominous crackling ‘sound’ that wouldn’t get any quieter or less persistent if I covered my ears with my hands.  I could feel dribbles running down my arms and back, still chilled from the refrigerated vending machines.\r\n\r\nI didn’t trust myself to say something that wouldn’t give them fodder to taunt me with, so I kept silent.\r\n\r\nCarefully, I climbed to my feet and turned my back on them to get my backpack off the top of the toilet.  Seeing it gave me pause.  It had been a khaki green, before, but now dark purple blotches covered it, most of the contents of a bottle of grape juice.  Pulling the straps around my shoulders, I turned around.  The girls weren’t there.  I heard the bathroom door bang shut, cutting off the sounds of their glee, leaving me alone in the bathroom, drenched.\r\n\r\nI approached the sink and stared at myself in the scratched, stained mirror that was bolted above it.  I had inherited a thin lipped, wide, expressive mouth from my mother, but my large eyes and my gawky figure made me look a lot more like my dad.  My dark hair was soaked enough that it clung to my scalp, neck and shoulders.  I was wearing a brown hooded sweatshirt over a green t-shirt, but colored blotches of purple, red and orange streaked both.  My glasses were beaded with the multicolored droplets of juice and soda.  A drip ran down my nose and fell from the tip to land in the sink.\r\n\r\nUsing a paper towel from the dispenser, I wiped my glasses off and put them on again.  The residual streaks made it just as hard to see, if not worse than it had been.\r\n\r\nDeep breaths, Taylor, I told myself.\r\n\r\nI pulled the glasses off to clean them again with a wet towel, and found the streaks were still there.\r\n\r\nAn inarticulate scream of fury and frustration escaped my lips, and I kicked the plastic bucket that sat just beneath the sink, sending it and the toilet brush inside flying into the wall.  When that wasn’t enough, I pulled off my backpack and used a two-handed grip to hurl it.  I wasn’t using my locker anymore: certain individuals had vandalized or broken into it on four different occasions.  My bag was heavy, loaded down with everything I’d anticipated needing for the day’s classes.  It crunched audibly on impact with the wall.\r\n\r\n“What the fuck!?” I screamed to nobody in particular, my voice echoing in the bathroom.  There were tears in the corners of my eyes.\r\n\r\n“The hell am I supposed to do!?”  I wanted to hit something, break something.  To retaliate against the unfairness of the world.  I almost struck the mirror, but I held back.  It was such a small thing that it felt like it would make me feel more insignificant instead of venting my frustration.\r\n\r\nI’d been enduring this from the very first day of high school, a year and a half ago.  The bathroom had been the closest thing I could find to refuge.  It had been lonely and undignified, but it had been a place I could retreat to, a place where I was off their radar.  Now I didn’t even have that.\r\n\r\nI didn’t even know what I was supposed to do for my afternoon classes.  Our midterm project for art was due, and I couldn’t go to class like this.  Sophia would be there, and I could just imagine her smug smile of satisfaction as I showed up looking like I’d botched an attempt to tie-dye everything I owned.\r\n\r\nBesides, I’d just thrown my bag against the wall and I doubted my project was still in one piece.\r\n\r\nThe buzzing at the edge of my consciousness was getting worse.  My hands shook as I bent over and gripped the edge of the sink, let out a long, slow breath, and let my defenses drop.  For three months, I’d held back.  Right now?  I didn’t care anymore.\r\n\r\nI shut my eyes and felt the buzzing crystallize into concrete information.  As numerous as stars in the night sky, tiny knots of intricate data filled the area around me.  I could focus on each one in turn, pick out details.  The clusters of data had been reflexively drifting towards me since I was first splashed in the face.  They responded to my subconscious thoughts and emotions, as much of a reflection of my frustration, my anger, my hatred for those three girls as my pounding heart and trembling hands were.  I could make them stop or direct them to move almost without thinking about it, the same way I could raise an arm or twitch a finger.\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes.  I could feel adrenaline thrumming through my body, blood coursing in my veins.  I shivered in response to the chilled soft drinks and juices the trio had poured over me, with anticipation and with just a little fear.  On every surface of the bathroom were bugs; Flies, ants, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, earwigs, beetles, wasps and bees.  With every passing second, more streamed in through the open window and the various openings in the bathroom, moving with surprising speed.  Some crawled in through a gap where the sink drain entered the wall while others emerged from the triangular hole in the ceiling where a section of foam tile had broken off, or from the opened window with peeling paint and cigarette butts squished out in the recesses.  They gathered around me and spread out over every available surface; primitive bundles of signals and responses, waiting for further instruction.\r\n\r\nMy practice sessions, conducted away from prying eyes, told me I could direct a single insect to move an antennae, or command the gathered horde to move in formation.  With one thought, I could single out a particular group, maturity or species from this jumble and direct them as I wished.  An army of soldiers under my complete control.\r\n\r\nIt would be so easy, so easy to just go Carrie on the school.  To give the trio their just desserts and make them regret what they had put me through: the vicious e-mails, the trash they’d upended over my desk, the flute –my mother’s flute– they’d stolen from my locker.  It wasn’t just them either.  Other girls and a small handful of boys had joined in, ‘accidentally’ skipping over me when passing out assignment handouts, adding their own voices to the taunts and the flood of nasty emails, to get the favor and attention of three of the prettier and more popular girls in our grade.\r\n\r\nI was all too aware that I’d get caught and arrested if I attacked my fellow students.  There were three teams of superheroes and any number of solo heroes in the city.  I didn’t really care.  The thought of my father seeing the aftermath on the news, his disappointment in me, his shame?  That was more daunting, but it still didn’t outweigh the anger and frustration.\r\n\r\nExcept I was better than that.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, I sent an instruction to the gathered swarm.   Disperse.  The word wasn’t as important  as the idea behind it.  They began to exit the room, disappearing into the cracks in the tile and through the open window.  I walked over to the door and stood with my back to it so nobody could stumble onto the scene before the bugs were all gone.\r\n\r\nHowever much I wanted to, I couldn’t really follow through.  Even as I trembled with humiliation, I managed to convince myself to pick up my backpack and head down the hall.  I made my way out of the school, ignoring the stares and giggles from everyone I walked past, and caught the first bus that headed in the general direction of home.  The chill of early spring compounded the discomfort of my soaked hair and clothes, making me shiver.\r\n\r\nI was going to be a superhero.  That was the goal I used to calm myself down at moments like these.  It was what I used to make myself get out of bed on a school day.  It was a crazy dream that made things tolerable.  It was something to look forward to, something to work towards.  It made it possible to keep from dwelling on the fact that Emma Barnes, leader of the trio, had once been my best friend.'),
('Gestation 2', 'Worm', 2, 'My thoughts were on Emma on the bus ride home.  For an outside observer, I think it’s easy to trivialize the importance of a ‘best friend’, but when you’re a kid, there’s nobody more important.  Emma had been my ‘BFF’ from grade one all the way through middle school.  It hadn’t been enough for us to spend our time together at school, so we had alternated staying at each others houses every weekend.  I remember my mother saying that we were so close we were practically sisters.\r\n\r\nA friendship that deep is intimate.  Not in the rude way, but just in terms of a no-holds-barred sharing of every vulnerability and weakness.\r\n\r\nSo when I got back from nature camp just a week before our first year at high school started, to find that she wasn’t talking to me?  That she was calling Sophia her best friend?  Discovering that she was now using every one of those secrets and vulnerabilities I had shared with her to wound me in the most vicious ways she could think of?  It was crushing.  There’s just no better way to say it.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to dwell on it any longer, I turned my attention to my backpack, setting it on the seat beside me and sorting through the contents.  Grape juice had stained it, and I had a suspicion I would have to get a new one.  I had bought it just four months ago, after my old one had been taken from my locker, and it had been just twelve bucks, so it wasn’t a huge issue.  The fact that my notebooks, textbooks and the two novels I’d shoved into my bag were wet with grape juice was more troubling.  I suspected that whichever girl had been holding the grape juice had aimed for the open top of my bag as she poured it.  I noted the destruction of my art project – the box I’d put it in was collapsed on the one side.  That bit was my fault.\r\n\r\nMy heart sank as I found the notebook with the white and black speckled hardcover.  The corner of the paper was soaked through with as much as a quarter of each page stained purple.  The ink had diluted and the pages were already turning wavy.\r\n\r\nThat notebook was – had been – my notes and journal for my hero career.  The testing and training I’d done with my powers, pages of crossed out name ideas, even the measurements I was using for my costume in progress.  After Emma, Madison and Sophia had stolen my last backpack and stuffed it in a wastebasket, I had realized how big a danger it was to have everything written down like that.  I had copied everything over into a new notebook in a simple cipher and wrote it bottom to top.  Now that notebook was spoiled, and I was looking at having to copy some two hundred pages of detailed writing into a new notebook if I wanted to preserve the information.  If I could even remember what was on all of the ruined pages.\r\n\r\nThe bus stopped a block away from my house, and I got off, trying to ignore the stares.  Even with the gawking, the knowledge that my notebook was ruined and my general nervousness about missing afternoon classes without permission, I felt better as I got closer to home.  It felt worlds better to know I could drop my guard, stop watching my back and that I could take a break from wondering when the next incident would happen.  I let myself into the house and headed straight for the shower, not even removing my backpack or taking off my shoes until I was in the bathroom.\r\n\r\nI stood under the stream with my clothes on the floor of the tub, hoping the water would help get the worst of the juice out.  I pondered.  I don’t know who said it, but at one point I had come across this notion about taking a negative and turning it into a positive.  I tried to take the day’s events and turn them around in my head, to see if I couldn’t find a more positive twist on it.\r\n\r\nOkay, so the first thing that came to mind was “Yet another reason to kill the trio.”  It wasn’t a serious thought – I was angry, but it wasn’t like I was going to actually kill them.   Somehow, I suspected that I’d hurt myself before I hurt them.  I was humiliated, frustrated, pissed, and I always had a weapon available – my power.  It was like having a loaded gun in your hand at all times.  Except my power wasn’t that great, so maybe it was more like having a taser.  It was hard not to think about using it when things got really bad.  Still, I didn’t think I had that killer instinct in me.\r\n\r\nNo, I told myself, forcing myself back to the subject of positive thinking.  Were there any upsides?  Art project wrecked, clothes probably unrecoverable, needing a new backpack…  notebook.  Somehow my mind fixated on that last part.\r\n\r\nI cranked the shower to off, then toweled dry, thinking.  I wrapped the towel around me, and rather than head to my room to get dressed, I put my wet clothes into a laundry hamper, grabbed my backpack and headed downstairs, through the kitchen and into the basement.\r\n\r\nMy house is old, and the basement was never renovated.  The walls and floor are concrete and the ceiling was exposed boards and electrical cords.  The furnace used to be coal fueled, and there was still an old coal chute, two feet by two feet, where the coal trucks used to come by to unload the winter’s supply of coal for heating the house.  The chute was boarded up, but around the time I was copying my original ‘superpower notebook’ over in code, I had decided to play it safe in all respects and start getting creative with my privacy.  It was then that I’d started using it.\r\n\r\nI removed one screw and removed the square wooden panel with the peeling white paint that covered the low end of the coal chute.  I retrieved a gym bag from inside and put the panel back in place without screwing it back in.\r\n\r\nI emptied the contents of the gym bag on the disused workbench that the house’s previous owner had left in our basement, then opened the windows that were at the same level as the driveway and front garden.  I closed my eyes and spent a minute exercising my power.  I wasn’t just grabbing every creepy crawly in a two block radius, though.  I was being selective, and I was gathering quite a few.\r\n\r\nIt would take time for all of them to arrive.  Bugs could move faster than you thought when they moved with purpose in a straight line, but even so, two blocks was a lot of ground for something so small to cover.  I busied myself with opening the bag and sorting out the contents.  My costume.\r\n\r\nThe first of the spiders started coming in through the open windows and congregating on the workbench.  My power didn’t give me a knowledge of the official names of the bugs I was working with, but anyone could recognize the spiders that were crawling into the room.  These were black widows.  One of the more dangerous spiders you could find in the States.  Their bite could be lethal, though it usually wasn’t, and they tended to bite with little provocation.  Even under my complete control, they spooked me.  At my request, the dozens upon dozens of spiders got into place on the workbench and began drawing out lines of webbing, laying the lines across one another, and weaving them into one work.\r\n\r\nThree months ago, after I’d recovered from the manifestation of my powers, I had started to prepare for the goal I had set for myself.  It had involved an exercise routine, training my power, research, and preparing my costume.  Costumes were harder than one might think.  While members of official teams surely had sources for that stuff, the rest of us were left to either buy costumes, put them together piecemeal with stuff bought from stores or make them from scratch.  Each option had its problems.  If you bought a costume online, you ran the risk of being traced, which could blow your secret identity before you’d even put a costume on.  You could put a costume together with stuff bought from stores, but very few people could do that and look good.  The final option, putting a costume together yourself, was just a hell of a lot of work and you could run into the issues of the prior two options – being traced or winding up with a lame costume – depending on where you got your materials and how you went about it.\r\n\r\nIn the second week after I’d figured out my powers, when I still wasn’t entirely sure what was going on, I had come across a segment on the discovery channel about a suit that was made to withstand attacks by bears.  That segment talked about how the suit was made of synthetic spider silk, which had inspired this particular project.  Why go synthetic when you can produce with the real thing?\r\n\r\nOkay, so it had been harder than that.  Not just any spider worked, and the black widow spiders themselves were hard to find.  They weren’t typically found in the northeastern states, where it was generally colder, but I was fortunate that that key element that made Brockton Bay a tourist destination and a hotspot for capes also made it a place where black widow spiders could live, if not thrive.  Namely, it was warm.  Thanks to the surrounding geography and the ocean bordering us on the east, Brockton Bay had some of the mildest winters you could find in the Northeastern States, and some of the most comfortably warm summers.  Both the black widows and the people running around in skintight costumes were thankful for that.\r\n\r\nWith my power, I had ensured the spiders could multiply.  I’d kept them in safe locations and fattened them on prey I directed straight to them.  I had flipped that mental switch that told them to breed and lay eggs as if it was summer, fed more prey to the hundreds of young that had resulted and had earned countless costume spinners for my trouble.  The biggest issue had been that black widows are territorial, so I’d had to spread them out to ensure they didn’t kill each other when I wasn’t around to control them.  Once a week or so, on my morning runs, I rotated the locations of the local spiders so I had a fresh supply all filled with proteins for the production of the essential materials.  This ensured that the spiders were always ready for working on the costume in the afternoon, after school.\r\n\r\nYeah, I needed a life.\r\n\r\nBut I had a badass costume.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t a great looking costume, just yet.  The fabric was a dirty yellow-gray.  The armored sections had been made out of finely arranged and layered shells and exoskeletons I’d cannibalized from the local insect population and then reinforced with dragline silk.  In the end, the armored parts had wound up dark mottled brown-gray.  I was okay with that.  When the entire thing was done, I planned to dye the fabric and paint the armor.\r\n\r\nThe reason I was so pleased with my costume was the fact that it was flexible, durable, and incredibly lightweight, considering the amount of armor I had put on it.  At one point I had screwed up the dimensions of one of the legs, and when I tried to cut it off to start fresh, I had found I couldn’t cut it with an x-acto knife.  I had needed to use wire cutters, and even that had been a chore.  As far as I figured, it was everything a superhero wanted for a costume.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t exactly willing to test it out, but I harbored hopes that it was bulletproof.  Or at least, that the armored sections over my vital areas were.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to finish my costume over the course of the month, then as the school year ended and the summer began, I would take the leap into the world of superheroics.\r\n\r\nBut the plan had changed.  I took off my towel and hung it from the corner of the bench, then began pulling on my costume to test the fit for the hundredth time.  The spiders obediently moved out of my way as I did so.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been standing in the shower, trying to find the good aspects in the day’s troubles, my thoughts had turned to my notebook.  I had realized I was procrastinating.  I was constantly planning, preparing, considering all of the possibilities.  There would always be more preparations, more stuff to study or test.  The destruction of my notebook had been the burning of a bridge.  I couldn’t go back and copy it into a fresh book or start a new one without delaying my game plan for at least a week.  I had to move forward.\r\n\r\nIt was time to do it.  I flexed my hand inside the glove.  I’d go out next week – no.  No more delays.  This weekend, I would be ready.');

('Gestation 3', 'Worm', 3, 'My training schedule consisted of running every morning and every other afternoon.  In the process, I had picked up a pretty good knowledge of the east side of the city.  Growing up in Brockton Bay, my parents had told me stuff like “stick to the Boardwalk”.  Even on my runs, I had scrupulously stayed on the Boardwalk and avoided the bad part of town.  Now it was Sunday night and I was in costume and breaking the rules.\r\n\r\nI had dyed and painted the costume on Friday, bought temporary costume pieces (belt, the straps for the mask and the lenses) on Saturday and finished the most necessary details over the course of my Sunday afternoon before heading out for the evening.  The costume wasn’t complete yet, lacking the full extent of the armor paneling I had planned out, but the armor covered the most essential areas – my face, chest, spine, stomach and major joints.  The mask design featured dull yellow lenses, the only color on the black and gray costume, as well as sections of armor designed to imitate a bug’s mandibles while simultaneously protecting my jaw.  The mask left my hair free, which did leave the back of my head more vulnerable, but that was just one of the sacrifices I’d had to make to go out in an unfinished costume.\r\n\r\nIt was just after midnight, and I was crossing the line between one of the nicest parts of town and the part of town where the crack whores and gangsters lived.  The distance between the two was thinner than one might think.\r\n\r\nThe Boardwalk was where the tourists came.  Running north-to-south along the beach, there were shops that sold dresses for over a thousand dollars, cafes with ludicrously expensive coffees and stretches of wooden walkways and beaches where tourists could get a great view of the ocean.  From pretty much any point on the Docks, you could see one of Brockton Bay’s landmarks, the Protectorate Headquarters.  Besides being a marvel of architectural design with its arches and towers, the PHQ was a floating base of operations that a squadron of local superheroes called home, outfitted with a forcefield bubble and a missile defense system.  There had never been occasion for either to be used, but I had to admit, it made you feel safer.\r\n\r\nIf you headed west from the Boardwalk, away from the water, you found yourself in the area the locals just called the ‘Docks’.  When the import/export business in Brockton Bay had dried up, there had been a whole lot of people who were suddenly out of work.  The richest and most resourceful people in town had managed to make more money, turning the city’s resources towards tech and banking, but all of the people who had been employed on the ships and in the warehouses had few options left to them.  They faced leaving Brockton Bay, sticking around while scraping up what little work they could or turning to more illicit activity.\r\n\r\nThis all contributed to the boom in the local supervillain population.  The potential for big money coupled with the number of eager-to-please mooks and henchmen made it the city to be for the villains in the late 90s.  It took a few years for the hero presence to establish and organize themselves, but they did, and there was something of an equilibrium now.  As far as cape population went, Brockton Bay wasn’t in the top 5 cities in the U.S., but it was probably in the top ten.\r\n\r\nJust moving from one block to the next, you could see the change in the area.  As I made my way into the Docks, I could see the quality of my surroundings decline steeply.  There were enough warehouses and apartments in the area for even the most destitute to find shelter, so the only people on the streets were unconscious drunks, whores and gang members.  I steered clear of any and all people I saw and ventured further into the area.\r\n\r\nAs I walked, I was using my powers to draw a swarm together, but kept them out of the way, moving just over the nearby rooftops and through the interior of buildings.  Anyone paying attention to the local cockroach population might think something was up, but there weren’t many lights on.  I doubted most of the buildings here even had power.\r\n\r\nThe lack of lights in the area was what made me stop and draw myself against the side of a building when I saw a spot of orange in the dark street ahead.  The orange was the flame of a lighter, and I was able to make out several faces around it.  They were Asian, some wearing hoodies, others wearing headbands or long sleeved shirts, but all wore the same colors.  Red and green.\r\n\r\nI knew who these guys were.  They were members from the local gang that left the tags ‘Azn Bad Boys’, ABB for short, all over the East end of the city.  More than a few went to my school.  As far as the criminal element in Brockton Bay went, they weren’t small potatoes.  While the typical gang members were just Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese and Chinese forcibly recruited from Brockton Bay’s high schools and lower class neighborhoods, the gang was led by a couple of people with powers.  Gangs didn’t tend to be that racially inclusive as far as who joined, so it said something that their leader had the ability to draw in members from so many different nationalities and keep them in line.\r\n\r\nThe street was unlit, so my ability to see was dependent on the moon and the few indoor lights that were still on and shining out onto the sidewalks. I started actively looking for their boss.  There were more gang members coming out of a two-story building, and they were gathering in the street.  They didn’t have the atmosphere of people who were just hanging out, either.  They were expressionless or scowling, and they weren’t talking.\r\n\r\nI spotted their boss as the gang pulled away from the door of the building to give him room.  I only knew about this guy from what I had heard on the news and read online, but I recognized him immediately.  He was a big guy, but not so big that he would send people running when he walked down the street, like some people with powers were.  He was a little over six feet, though, which put him head and shoulders above most of the gang members.  He had an ornate metal mask over his face, and wasn’t wearing a shirt, despite the chill.  Sprawling tattoos covered his body from the neck down, all depicting dragons from Eastern mythology.\r\n\r\nHe went by ‘Lung’, had successfully gone toe to toe with whole teams of heroes and had managed to keep himself out of jail, as evidenced by his presence here.  As for his powers, I only knew what I could scrounge up online, and there were no guarantees there.  I mean, for all I knew, he could have misled people about what his powers did, he could have a power he was keeping up his sleeve for an emergency, or he could even have a very subtle power that people couldn’t see at work.\r\n\r\nThe information online and in the papers had told me this: Lung could gradually transform.  Maybe it was based on adrenaline, his emotional state, or something, but whatever it was, it made his powers more potent the longer he was in a fight.  He healed at a superhuman rate, got stronger, got tougher, got bigger, and he grew armor plating complete with blades at each fingertip.  Rumor had it that he even grew wings if he fought long enough.  If that wasn’t enough, he was a pyrokinetic, which meant he could create flame out of thin air, shape it, intensify it, and so on.  That power apparently got stronger as he transformed, too.  As far as I knew, there wasn’t an upper limit to how strong he could get.  He only started returning to normal when there was nobody left to fight.\r\n\r\nLung wasn’t the only one with powers in the ABB.  He had a flunky, a scary sociopath called Oni Lee, who could teleport or create doubles of himself – I wasn’t a hundred percent sure on the details – but Oni Lee had a distinctive look, and I didn’t see him in the crowd.  If there was anyone else with powers that I needed to watch out for, I hadn’t seen or heard anything about them in my research.\r\n\r\nLung began talking in a deep, commanding voice.  I couldn’t make out the words, but it sounded like he was giving instructions.  As I watched, one of the gang members drew a butterfly knife from his pocket, and another of them put his hand on his waistband.  Between the gloom and the fact that I was standing half a block away, I couldn’t see well, but a dark shape stood out against his green t-shirt.  Chances were it was a gun handle.  My pulse sped up a bit as I saw the gun, which was silly.  Lung was more dangerous than fifty people with guns.\r\n\r\nI decided to move away from where I was and find a better vantage point to monitor their conversation, which seemed like a good compromise between my curiosity and my self preservation.  I slowly backed away from where I was, glancing over my shoulder to make sure nobody was watching, and then circled around the rear of the building I was lurking beside.\r\n\r\nMy investigation paid off.  Halfway down the alley, I saw a fire escape that was leading up the back of the building that Lung and his gang were standing in front of.  The feet of my costume had soft soles, so I was nearly silent as I ascended.\r\n\r\nThe roof was covered in gravel and cigarette butts, which made me think I wouldn’t be nearly so quiet walking over it.  Instead, I walked on the raised outside lip of the roof.  As I neared the part of the roof directly above Lung and his gang of ‘Azn Bad Boys’, I crouched and crawled forward on my stomach.  It was dark enough that I doubted they would see me if I jumped up and down and waved my arms, but there was no reason to be stupid.\r\n\r\nBeing at the top of a two story building when they were on the ground floor made it hard to hear them.  Lung had a strong accent, as well, which meant I had to wait until he had spoken a few sentences before I could figure out what he was saying.  It helped that his mooks were utterly, respectfully silent as he spoke.\r\n\r\nLung was snarling, “…the children, just shoot.  Doesn’t matter your aim, just shoot.  You see one lying on the ground?  Shoot the little bitch twice more to be sure.  We give them no chances to be clever or lucky, understand?”\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of assent.\r\n\r\nSomeone else lit up a cigarette, and then leaned over to light a cigarette for the guy next to him.  In those moments that his hand wasn’t cupped around the flame, I could see the gathered faces of just a dozen or so of the gangsters gathered around Lung.  In hands, waistbands and holsters, I could see the dark metal of guns reflecting the orange flame.  If I had to hazard a guess, all of them had weapons.\r\n\r\nThey were going to kill kids?'),
('Gestation 4', 'Worm', 4, 'I felt a chill.  A part of me really wished that I had thought to get my hands on a disposable cell phone.  I didn’t have a utility belt, but the spade shaped section of armor that hung over my spine hid a set of EpiPens, a pen and notepad, a tube of pepper spray meant to hang off a key chain and a zippered pouch of chalk dust.  I could have fit a cell phone back there.  With a cell phone, I could have alerted the real heroes about the fact that Lung was planning to take a score of his flunkies to go and shoot kids.\r\n\r\nAt least, that’s what I had heard.  I was in a state of disbelief, turning the words around in my head to think of a different context that would make sense of it.  It wasn’t so much the fact that he would do something like that.  I just had a hard time wrapping my head around the idea that anyone would.\r\n\r\nLung answered a question for one of his gang members, lapsing briefly into another language.  He grabbed one of his minion’s arms and twisted it to an angle where he could get a look at the guy’s watch, so I guessed it had something to do with their timing or when they were leaving.  The gang member who’d had his arm twisted winced as Lung let it go, but didn’t complain.\r\n\r\nWhat was I supposed to do?  I doubted I could find any place in the Docks that would be willing to let me inside to use their phone.  If I headed to the Boardwalk, I wasn’t sure I would find any places that were still open, and I didn’t have change for a payphone. That was another oversight I would have to correct for the next time I went out.  Cell phone, spare change.\r\n\r\nA car pulled up, and another three guys dressed in gang colors got out and and joined the crowd.  Shortly after, the group – twenty or twenty five in total – started walking north, passing below me as they walked down the street.\r\n\r\nI was out of time to consider my options.  As much as I didn’t want to face it, there was really only one option that I could have no regrets about.  I shut my eyes and focused on every bug on the neighborhood, including the sizable swarm I had gathered on the way into the Docks.  I took control of each of them.\r\n\r\nAttack.\r\n\r\nIt was dark enough that I could only tell where the swarm was with my power.  That meant I couldn’t even tune out the swarm if I wanted to have any idea about what was going on.  My brain was filled with horrendous amounts of information, as I sensed each bite, each sting.  As the thousands of insects and arachnids swarmed over and around the group, I could almost see the outlines of each person, just by sensing the shapes of the surfaces the bugs were crawling on, or the areas the vermin wasn’t occupying.  I focused on keeping the more venomous types at bay for the time being – I didn’t need any allergic thugs going into anaphylactic shock from a bee sting or getting serious complications from the bite of a brown recluse spider.\r\n\r\nI sensed the fire through the swarm before I realized what I was looking at with my eyes.  My power told me of the bugs’ recognition of the heat, but I didn’t even have time to devote conscious thought to block out the instincts the fire set in motion before the damage was done.  The primitive thought processes of my bugs were reduced to confused impulses to alternately flee and to pursue the heat and the light they so often used for navigation.  Many bugs died or were crippled by the heat.  From my vantage point, I could see Lung lashing out with streams of fire from his hands, directing them at the sky.\r\n\r\nI suppressed a laugh, feeling heady with adrenaline.  Was that all he could do?  I directed the swarm to gather, so those who weren’t already biting and stinging were in the midst of the gang.  If he wanted to turn his flames on the swarm, he would have to set his own people on fire.\r\n\r\nThe heated air and the smells gave me enough information, by way of my insects, to tell where Lung was in the crowd.  I took a deep breath, and then sent in the reserves.  I took a share of the venomous types I’d held at bay and directed them to Lung.  A handful of bees, wasps, a number of the more poisonous spiders, like black widows and brown recluses, and dozens of fire ants.\r\n\r\nHe healed fast when his power was working.  Everything I’d read online said that people with healing abilities would shrug off the effects of poisons or drugs, so I knew I’d have to pump him full of enough venom to overwhelm that aspect of his power.  Besides, he was a big guy.  I judged he could take it.\r\n\r\nFrom the information that I could glean from my bugs, Lung already had maybe a quarter of his body covered in armor.  Triangular sections of metallic plating were piercing through his skin, where they would continue to grow and overlap until he was nigh impenetrable.  If they weren’t already, his fingertips and toes would become like blades or metal claws.\r\n\r\nI felt a sadistic glee as I organized the attack on Lung.  I directed the flying insects to attack his face.  With distaste, I focused the crawling ants and spiders on… other vulnerable areas.  I did my best to ignore the feedback that I got from that particular attack, as I most definitely did not want the same kind of topographical map that the swarm had provided just a minute ago.  Lung was bad news, and I needed him out of action as soon as possible.  That meant delivering the hurt.\r\n\r\nRationale aside, I did feel a stab of guilt about taking pleasure in someone else’s pain.  I quieted that moment’s remorse by reminding myself that Lung had spread tragedy, addiction and death to innumerable families.  He had been planning to kill kids.\r\n\r\nLung exploded.  No metaphor there.  He detonated in a blast of rolling fire that set his clothes, several pieces of litter and one of his gang members alight.  Almost every bug in his immediate vicinity died or was crippled by the wave of extreme heat.  From my vantage point on the roof, I watched as he turned himself into a human bomb a second time.  The second explosion turned his clothes to rags and sent his people fleeing for cover.  He stepped out of the smoke with his hands burning like torches, the silvery scales that covered nearly a third of his body reflecting the flame.\r\n\r\nDamn, damn, damn.  He was fireproof?  Or skilled enough at using fire to superheat the air around him without burning himself?  The meager scraps of clothing that covered him were burning away, and fire licked and danced around his hands without him seeming to care.\r\n\r\nHe roared.  It wasn’t the monstrous roar one might expect, but a very human sound of rage and frustration.  As human as it sounded, though, it was loud.  All the way down the street neighborhood, lights and flashlights flickered on in response to the explosions and the roar.  I even saw a few faces peering through windows to see the action.  Idiots.  If Lung’s next attack shattered any glass, they could get hurt.\r\n\r\nFrom where I was crouched on the side of the roof, I directed some of the more harmless insects to attack Lung.  He lashed out with fire the moment they started crawling on him, which I had more or less expected.  He was managing to kill the majority of the bugs with each burst of flame, and knowing what I did about his powers, I knew his flames would only get bigger, hotter and more dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn a typical fight, you figure someone would get weaker as the fight dragged on.  They would take their lumps, get tired, exhaust their bag of tricks.  With Lung, it was the opposite.  I found myself regretting that I had used only a relatively small number of the more venomous bugs, because it was becoming clear that what I’d used wasn’t having much effect.  He had no idea where I was, so I figured I still had the upper hand, but my options and the number of bugs in my swarm were running out.  Despite my earlier glee, I wasn’t sure I could win this anymore.\r\n\r\nI hissed through my teeth, all too aware that time was running out.  Before long, Lung would set fire to the city block, become immune to bites and stings in general, or destroy my entire swarm.  I had to get creative.  I had to get meaner.\r\n\r\nI focused my attention on a lone wasp, and piloted it around Lung’s back, up behind his head and then had it circle around to his face and straight at his eyeball.  The wasp touched his eyelash, and he blinked before it could hit the target.  As a consequence, the stinger only sank into his eyelid, prompting yet another explosion of fire and a scream of rage.\r\n\r\nAgain. I thought.  A honeybee this time.  I wasn’t sure if he eventually got armor plated eyelids, but maybe I could use the stings to make his eyes swell shut?  He wouldn’t be able to fight if he couldn’t see.\r\n\r\nThe bee struck home this time, sinking his stinger into the ball of Lung’s eye.  It surprised me in that it didn’t stick or kill the bee, so I had the bee sting again, and this time the barbs let it stick in the skin at the corner of his eye, at the side of his nose.  The bee died that time, leaving some tiny organs and a venom sac hanging from the stinger.\r\n\r\nI expected him to explode again.  He didn’t.  Instead, he set himself on fire, head to toe.  I waited a moment, poised to attack with the next wasp to attack the moment he dropped his guard, but as the seconds passed, I realized he wasn’t planning on extinguishing himself.  My heart sank.\r\n\r\nSurely he was burning up all of the oxygen in his vicinity.  Didn’t he need to breathe?  What the hell was the fuel source for his fire?\r\n\r\nStanding in the street, he turned around, searching for me, with the flames that licked and rolled over his body casting light where there had been only gloom.  Abruptly, he hunched over.  I wondered if – I hoped – the various toxins and venoms in his system had done the trick.  Then his back separated into two.  A meaty looking gap appeared along his spine, followed by an eruption of long metallic scales all down the gap.  After bristling for a few moments, the scales lay flat like dominoes falling.  He stood and stretched, and I could swear he was a foot taller, now with an armor plated spine.\r\n\r\nStill on fire, head to toe.\r\n\r\nIf the ‘constantly on fire’ thing had tipped the balance of the fight to futile, watching Lung grow and look stronger than ever had pushed me to the point of being spooked.  I started thinking about an exit strategy.  Rationally, I figured, Lung’s men were scattered to the four winds and they were probably in pretty rough shape.  Whatever Lung had been planning for tonight, chances were he wasn’t going to be able to carry out whatever plans he’d had after this debacle.  I had more or less accomplished what I needed to, and I figured I could run and find a way to contact the PHQ just in case.\r\n\r\nThat was the rational perspective.  Justifications aside, I just wanted to leave, right then.  If things dragged on and I stayed put, there was a very real chance that Lung would give evidence to the rumor that he could grow wings, at which point I would be spotted for sure.  I wouldn’t be able to beat Lung at this point, anyway, which left only a graceless retreat as the remaining option.\r\n\r\nLung had his back turned to me, so I lifted myself up, slowly.  Crouching, I backed up to retreat to the fire escape, watching Lung carefully as I set foot on the gravel of the roof.\r\n\r\nAs if a gunshot had gone off, Lung whirled around to stare at me.  One of his eyes was just a glowing line behind his mask, but the other was like an orb of molten metal.\r\n\r\nA victorious roar filled the air, less human than the outcry he had made earlier, and I felt a kind of resignation.  Enhanced hearing.  The package of powers the bastard got from his transformation included superhuman hearing.'),
('Gestation 5', 'Worm', 5, 'You don’t properly appreciate what superhuman strength means until you see someone leap from the sidewalk to the second floor of a building on the far side of the street.  He didn’t make it all the way to the roof, but he came to a point maybe three quarters of the way up.  I wasn’t sure just how Lung kept from falling, but I could only guess that he just buried his fingertips into the building’s exterior.\r\n\r\nI heard scraping and crunching as he ascended, and looked to my only escape route.  I didn’t harbor any delusions as far as my ability to get down the fire escape before Lung came over the top of the roof and deduced where I’d run off to.  Worse, at that point he could probably just beat me to the street level by jumping off the roof, or even just shoot fire at me through the gaps in the metal while I was halfway down.  The irony of the fire escape being anything but didn’t escape me.\r\n\r\nI wished I could fly.  My school offered the choice between Chemistry, Biology and Physics, with Basic Science for the underachievers.  I hadn’t picked Physics, but I was still pretty sure that no matter how many I could gather together, jumping off the roof with a swarm of flying insects gripping me would be just as ineffective as the 9 year old superhero wannabes you heard about in the news, jumping off ledges with umbrellas and bedsheets.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, I was stuck where I was.\r\n\r\nReaching inside the convex armor that covered my spine, I ran my fingers over the things I had buckled in there.  The EpiPens were meant to treat anaphylactic shock from allergic reactions to bee stings and the like, and likely wouldn’t do a thing to Lung, even if I could get close enough and find a point to inject.  Worst case scenario, the injections would supercharge his power by prompting a surge of whatever hormones or endorphins fueled his power.  Not useful, dangerous at best.  I had a pouch of chalk dust that was meant for climbers and gymnasts, I had seen it in the sports store when I was buying the lenses for my mask.  I had gloves and didn’t think I needed the dryness and extra traction, but I had gotten the idea that it could be useful to throw at an invisible enemy, and bought it on a whim.  In retrospect, it had been kind of a dumb purchase, since my power let me find foes like that with my bugs.  As a tool against Lung… I wasn’t sure if it would explode like regular dust could when exposed to flame, but fire didn’t hurt him anyways.  Scratch that option.\r\n\r\nI tugged the little canister of pepper spray free from my armor.  It was a black tube, three inches long, not much thicker around than a pen, with a trigger and a safety switch.  It had been a gift from my dad, after I had started to go on my morning jogs for training.  He had warned me to vary my route, and had given me the pepper spray for protection, along with a chain to clip it to my belt loop so it couldn’t be taken and used against me by an attacker.  In costume, I had opted not to keep the chain for the sake of moving quietly.  Using my thumb, I flicked the safety off and positioned the tube so I was ready to fire.  I crouched to make myself a smaller target, and waited for him to show himself.\r\n\r\nLung’s hands, still on fire, were the first thing to show up, gripping the edge of the roof hard enough to bend the material that covered the roof’s raised lip.  His hands were quickly followed by his head and torso as he hauled himself up.  He looked like he was made of overlapping knives or spades, smouldering yellow-orange with the low temperature flame.  There was no skin to be seen, and he was easily seven or eight feet tall, judging by the length of his arms and torso.  His shoulders alone were three feet across at the very least.  Even the one eye that he had open looked metallic, a glowing, almond shaped pool of liquid-hot metal.\r\n\r\nI aimed for the open eye, but the spray fired off at a sharp angle, just glancing off his shoulder.  Where the spray grazed him, it ignited into a short lived fireball.\r\n\r\nI swore under my breath and fumbled with the device.  While he brought his leg over the edge, I adjusted my angle and shot again.  This time – with a small tweak of my aim mid-shot – I hit him in the face.  The ignited spray rolled off of him, but the contents still did the trick.  He screamed, letting go of the roof with one hand, clutching the side of his face where his good eye was.\r\n\r\nIt had been vain to hope that he would slip and fall.  I just counted myself lucky that however metallic his face looked, there were still parts of it vulnerable to the spray.\r\n\r\nLung hauled himself over the edge of the roof.  I had him hurting… I just couldn’t do anything about it.  My bugs were officially useless, there was nothing left in my utility sheath, and I would hurt myself more than I hurt Lung if I attacked him.  Making a mental note to pick myself up a concealable knife or baton if I managed to live through this, I bolted for the fire escape.\r\n\r\n“Muh… Motherfucker!”  Lung screamed.  With my back turned, there was no way to see it, but the roof was briefly illuminated before the wave of flame hit me from behind.  Knocked off balance, I skidded on the gravel and hit the raised lip of the roof, just by the fire escape.  Frantically, I patted myself down.  My costume wasn’t on fire, but my hair – I hurriedly ran my hands over it to make sure it hadn’t been ignited.\r\n\r\nSmall mercies, I thought, that there was no tar used on the roof.  I could just imagine the flames igniting the rooftop, and just how little I’d be able to do if it happened.\r\n\r\nLung stood, slowly, still covering part of his face with his hand.  He walked with a slight limp as he approached me.  Blindly, he lashed out with a broad wave of flame that rolled over half the roof.  I covered my head with my hands and brought my knees to my chest as the hot air and flame rushed over me.  My costume seemed to take the brunt of it, but it was still hot enough I had to bite my lip to stop from making a sound.\r\n\r\nLung stopped advancing, slowly turning his head from one side to another.\r\n\r\n“Cock.  Sucker,” he growled in his heavily accented voice, his cussing interrupted by his panting for breath, “Move.  Give me something to aim for.”\r\n\r\nI held my breath and stayed as still as possible.  What could I do?  I still had the pepper spray in my hand, but even if I got him again, I was running the risk that he would lash out and bake me alive before I could move.  If I moved first, he would hear me and I would get knocked around by another blast of flame, probably before I could get to my feet.\r\n\r\nLung moved his hand from his face.  He blinked a few times, then looked around, then blinked a few more times.  It was a matter of seconds before he could see well enough to make me out from the shadows.  Wasn’t pepper spray supposed to put someone down for thirty minutes?  How was this monster not an A-Lister?\r\n\r\nHe suddenly moved, flames wreathing his hands, and I screwed my eyes shut.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard the crackling whoosh of the flame and wasn’t burned alive, I opened my eyes again.  Lung was firing streams of flame, aiming for the edge of the roof of the adjacent building, a three story apartment.  I looked to see what he was aiming at, but couldn’t make anything out in the gloom or in the brief second of light Lung’s flames afforded.\r\n\r\nWith no warning, a massive shape landed atop Lung with an impact I could swear people heard at the other end of the street.  The size of a van, the ‘massive object’ was animal rather than vehicle, resembling a cross between a lizard and a tiger, with tangles of muscle and bone where it ought to have skin, scales or fur.  Lung was now on his knees, holding one of the beast’s sizable claws away from his face with his own clawed hand.\r\n\r\nLung used his free hand to strike the creature across the snout.  Even though he was smaller than the beast, the impact made it rear back.  It took a few short steps back in reaction, and then rhino-charged him off the edge of the roof.  They hit the street with an audible crash.\r\n\r\nI stood, aware I was shaking like a leaf.  I was so unsteady on my feet, from the mixed relief and fear, that I almost fell over again as two more impacts shook the roof.  Two more creatures, similar to the first in texture, but slightly different in size and shape, had arrived on the rooftop.  These two each had a pair of riders.  I watched as the people slid off the backs of the animals.  There were two girls, a guy, and a fourth I identified as male only because of the height.  The tall one approached me, while the others hurried to the edge of the roof to watch Lung and the creature duke it out.\r\n\r\n“You really saved us a lot of trouble,” he told me.  His voice was deep, masculine, but muffled by the helmet he wore.  He was dressed entirely in black, a costume I realized was basically motorcycle leathers and a motorcycle helmet.  The only thing that made me think it was a costume was the visor of his helmet.  The full-face visor was sculpted to look like a stylized skull, and was as black as the rest of his costume, with only the faint highlights of reflected light on the surface to give a sense of what it was.  It was one of those costumes that people put together out of what they can scrounge up, and it wasn’t half bad if you didn’t look too close.  He reached out a hand towards me, and I leaned away, wary.\r\n\r\nI didn’t know what to say, so I stuck to my policy of not saying anything that could get me into a worse situation.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing his hand, the man in black jerked his thumb over one shoulder, “When we got word Lung was aiming to come after us tonight, we were pretty freaked.  We were arguing strategy for the better part of the day.  We eventually decided, fuck it, we’d meet him halfway.  Wing it.  Not my usual way of doing things, but yeah.”\r\n\r\nBehind him, one of the girls whistled sharply and pointed down at the street.  The two monsters the group had been riding on bounded across the roof and leaped down to the street to join the fight.\r\n\r\nThe guy in black kept talking, “Wouldn’t you know, his flunky Lee is there with a half dozen guys, but Lung and the rest of his gang are nowhere to be found,” he laughed, a surprisingly normal sound for someone wearing a mask with a skull on it.\r\n\r\n“Lee’s no slouch in a fight, but there’s a reason he’s not leader of the ABB.  He got spooked without his boss there and ran.  I guess you’re responsible for that?”  Skull-mask waited for a response from me.  When I didn’t offer one, he ventured towards the edge of the roof and looked down, then spoke without turning to look at me, “Lung is getting creamed.  The fuck you do to him?”\r\n\r\n“Pepper spray, wasp and bee stings, fire ants and spider bites,” the second of the girls said, answering the question for me.  She was dressed in a skintight outfit that combined black with a pale shade of blue or purple – I couldn’t tell in the dark – and her dark blond hair was long and windblown.  The girl grinned as she added, “He’s not holding up too well.  Gonna feel a helluvalot worse tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nThe man in black suddenly turned to look at me, “Introductions.  That’s Tattletale.  I’m Grue.  The girl with the dogs-” he pointed to the other girl, the one who had whistled and directed the monsters.  She wasn’t in costume unless I counted a plaid skirt, army boots, a torn-up sleeveless T-shirt and a hard plastic, dollar-store rottweiler mask as a costume. “-We call her Bitch, her preference, but in the interests of being P.G., the good guys and media decided to call her Hellhound instead.  Last and certainly least, we have Regent.”\r\n\r\nI finally caught up with what he was saying.  Those monsters were dogs?\r\n\r\n“Fuck you, Grue,” Regent retorted, with a chuckle and a tone of voice that made it clear he wasn’t really that offended.  He was wearing a white mask, not quite as decorative or made up as the ones I associated with the carnivals in Venice, but similar.  He’d placed a silver coronet around his short black curls, and wore a ruffled white shirt with skintight leggings tucked into knee-high boots.  The outfit was very renaissance faire.  He had a build that made me think more of a dancer than a bodybuilder.\r\n\r\nIntroductions done, Grue looked at me for several long moments.  After a few seconds, he asked me, “Hey, you okay?  You hurt?”\r\n\r\n“The reason she’s not introducing herself isn’t because she’s hurt,” Tattletale told him, as she continued to lean over the edge of the roof and watch whatever was going on at the street level, “It’s because she’s shy.”\r\n\r\nTattletale turned around and it looked like she was going to say something else, but she stopped, turning her head.  The smile she’d been wearing faded, “Heads up.  We’ve gotta scram.”\r\n\r\nBitch nodded in response and whistled, one short whistle followed by two long ones.  After a brief pause, the building was suddenly rattled by impacts.  In just moments, the three creatures of hers leaped from the alleys to either side of the building and onto the roof.\r\n\r\nGrue turned towards me.  I was still standing on the opposite end of the roof, by the fire escape. “Hey, want a ride?”\r\n\r\nI looked at the creatures – dogs?  They were bloodied, snarling creatures out of a nightmare.  I shook my head.  He shrugged.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” Tattletale said to me, seating herself just behind Bitch, “What’s your name?”\r\n\r\nI stared at her.  My voice caught in my throat before I was able to get the words out, “I don’t… I haven’t picked one yet.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Bug, a cape is gonna show up in less than a minute.  You did us a solid by dealing with Lung, so take my advice.  Someone from the Protectorate shows up, finds two bad guys duking it out, they’re not going to let one walk away.  You should get out of here,”  She said.  She flashed me a smile.  She had one of those vulpine grins that turned up at the corners.  Behind her simple black domino style mask, her eyes were glittering with mischief.  If she had red hair, she would have made me think of a fox.  She kind of did, anyways.\r\n\r\nWith that, they leaped over my head, one of the three beasts hitting or stepping on the fire escape on the way down, eliciting a screech of metal on metal.\r\n\r\nWhen I realized what had just happened, I could have cried.  It was easy enough to pin down Regent, Tattletale and Bitch as teenagers.  It wasn’t much of an intuitive leap to guess that Grue had been one too.  The ‘children’ Lung had mentioned, the ones I had gone to so much effort to save tonight, were bad guys.  Not only that, but they had mistaken me for one, too.');

('Gestation 6', 'Worm', 6, 'I heard the cape arrive on his souped up motorcycle.  I didn’t want to be seen fleeing the scene of a fight, and risk being labeled one of the bad guys by yet another person, but I wasn’t about to get closer to the street either, in case Lung was feeling better.  Since there was nowhere to go, I just stayed put.  Just resting felt good.\r\n\r\nIf you’d asked me just a few hours ago about how I thought I would feel meeting a big name superhero, I would have used words like excited and giddy.  The reality was that I was almost too exhausted to care.\r\n\r\nIt looked as though he flew up onto the roof, but the six-foot long weapon the man held kind of jerked as he landed.  I was pretty sure I saw the tines of a grappling hook retreating back into the end of the weapon.  So this was what Armsmaster looked like in person, I thought.\r\n\r\nThe largest superhero organization in the world was the Protectorate, spanning Canada and the States, with ongoing talks about including Mexico in the deal.  It was a government sponsored league of superheroes with a base in each ‘cape city’.  That is, they had a team set up in each city with a sizable population of heroes and villains.  Brockton Bay’s team was officially ‘The Protectorate East-North-East’, and were headquartered in the floating, forcefield-shrouded island that you could see from the Boardwalk.  This guy, Armsmaster, was the guy in charge of the local team.  When the core group of the top Protectorate members from around Canada and the States assembled in that classic ‘v’ formation for the photo shoots, Armsmaster was one of the guys in the wings.  This was a guy who had his own action figures.  Poseable Armsmaster with interchangeable Halberd parts.\r\n\r\nHe really did look like a superhero, not like some guy in a costume.  It was an important distinction.  He wore body armor, dark blue with silver highlights, had a sharply angled v-shaped visor covering his eyes and nose.  With only the lower half of his face exposed, I could see a beard trimmed to trace the edges of his jaw.  If I had to judge, with only the lower half of his face to go by, I’d guess he was in his late twenties or early thirties.\r\n\r\nHis trademark and weapon was his Halberd, which was basically a spear with an axe head on the end, souped up with gadgets and the kind of technology you generally only saw in science fiction.  He was the kind of guy who appeared on magazine covers and did interviews on TV, so you could find almost anything about Armsmaster through various media, short of his secret identity.  I knew his weapon could cut through steel as though it was butter, that it had plasma injectors for stuff that the blade alone couldn’t cut and that he could fire off directed electromagnetic pulses to shut down forcefields and mechanical devices.\r\n\r\n“You gonna fight me?” He called out.\r\n\r\n“I’m a good guy,” I said.\r\n\r\nStepping closer to me, he tilted his head, “You don’t look like one.”\r\n\r\nThat stung, especially coming from him.  It was like Michael Jordan saying you sucked at basketball.  “That’s… not intentional,” I responded, not a little defensively, “I was more than halfway done putting the costume together when I realized it was already looking more edgy than I’d intended, and I couldn’t do anything about it by then.”\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause.  Nervously, I turned my eyes from that opaque visor.  I glanced at his chest emblem, a silhouette of his visor in blue against a silver background, and was struck with the ridiculous thought that I had once owned a pair of underpants with his emblem on the front.\r\n\r\n“You’re telling the truth,” he said.  It was a definitive statement, which startled me.  I wanted to ask how he knew, but I wasn’t about to do or say anything that might change his mind.\r\n\r\nHe approached closer, looking me over as I sat there with my arms around my knees, he asked, “You need a hospital?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said. “Don’t think so.  I’m as surprised as you are.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a new face,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t even come up with a name yet.  You know how hard it is to come up with a bug-themed name that doesn’t make me sound like a supervillain or a complete dork?”\r\n\r\nHe chuckled, and it sounded warm, very normal, “I wouldn’t know.  I got into the game early enough that I didn’t have to worry about missing out on all of the good names.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause in the conversation.  I suddenly felt awkward.  I don’t know why, but I admitted to him, “I almost died.”\r\n\r\n“That’s why we have the Ward program,” he said.  There was no judgement in his tone, no pressure.  Just a statement.\r\n\r\nI nodded, more to give a response than out of any agreement with the answer.  The Wards were the under-eighteen subdivision of the Protectorate, and Brockton Bay did have its own team of Wards, with the same naming convention as the Protectorate; The Wards East-North-East.  I had considered applying to join, but the notion of escaping the stresses of high school by flinging myself into a mess of teenage drama, adult oversight and schedules seemed self-defeating.\r\n\r\n“You get Lung?” I asked, to change the subject from the Wards.  I was pretty sure that he was obligated to try and induct new heroes into either the Protectorate or the Wards, depending on their age, to promote the whole agenda of organized heroes who are accountable for their actions, and I really didn’t want him to get on my case about joining.\r\n\r\n“Lung was unconscious, beaten and battered when I arrived.  I pumped him full of tranquilizers to be safe and temporarily restrained him under a steel cage I welded to the sidewalk.  I’ll pick him up on my way back.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” I said, “With him in jail, I’ll feel like I accomplished something today.  Only reason I started the fight was because I overheard him telling his men to shoot some kids.  Only realized later that he was talking about some other villains.”\r\n\r\nArmsmaster turned to look at me.  So I told him, walking him through the fight in general, the arrival of the teenage bad guys, and their general descriptions.  Before I finished, he was pacing back and forth on the roof.\r\n\r\n“These guys.  They knew I was coming?”\r\n\r\nI nodded, once.  As much respect as I had for Armsmaster, I wasn’t in much of a mood to repeat myself.\r\n\r\n“That explains a lot,” he said, staring off into the distance.  After a few moments, he went on to explain, “They’re slippery.  On those few occasions we do manage to get in a toe to toe fight with them, they either win, or they get away more or less unscathed, or both.  We know so little about them.  Grue and Hellhound were working on their own before they joined the group, so there’s some information there, but the other two?  They’re nonentities.  If the girl Tattletale has some way of detecting or tracking us, it would go a long way towards explaining why they’re doing as well as they are.”\r\n\r\nIt kind of surprised me to hear one of the top level heroes admitting to being anything less than perfectly on top of things.\r\n\r\n“It’s funny,” I said, after a few moment’s thought, “They didn’t seem that hardcore.  Grue said they were kind of panicking when they heard Lung was coming after them, and they were casually joking around while the fight was going on.  Grue was making fun of Regent.”\r\n\r\n“They said all this in front of you?” he asked.\r\n\r\nI shrugged, “I think they thought I was helping them out.  The way Tattletale talked, I think she thought I was a bad guy too or something.”  With a touch of bitterness, I said, “Dunno, I guess it was the costume that led them to that assumption.”\r\n\r\n“Could you have taken them in a fight?” Armsmaster asked me.\r\n\r\nI started to shrug, and winced a little.  I was feeling a little sore in the shoulder, where I’d tumbled on the roof after being blasted by Lung’s flames.  I said, “Like you said, we don’t know a lot about them, but I think that girl with the dogs-”\r\n\r\n“Hellhound,” Armsmaster said.\r\n\r\n“I think she could have kicked my ass on her own, so no.  I probably couldn’t have fought them.”\r\n\r\n“Then count it as a good thing that they got the wrong impression,” Armsmaster said.\r\n\r\n“I’ll try to look at it that way,” I said, struck by how he easily he was able to employ the whole ‘take a negative and turn it into a positive’ mindset I’d been trying to maintain.  I envied that.\r\n\r\n“That a girl,” he said, “And while we’re looking forward, we need to decide where we go from here.”\r\n\r\nMy heart sank.  I knew he was going to bring up the Wards again.\r\n\r\n“Who gets the credit for Lung?”\r\n\r\nCaught off guard, I looked up at him.  I started to speak, but he held up his hand.\r\n\r\n“Hear me out.  What you’ve done tonight is spectacular.  You played a part in getting a major villain into custody.  You just need to consider the consequences.”\r\n\r\n“Consequences,” I muttered, even as the word spectacular rang in my ears.\r\n\r\n“Lung has an extensive gang throughout Brockton Bay and neighboring cities.  More than that, he has two superpowered flunkies.  Oni Lee and Bakuda.”\r\n\r\nI shook my head, “I know about Oni Lee, and Grue mentioned fighting him.  I’ve never heard of Bakuda.”\r\n\r\nArmsmaster nodded, “Not surprising.  She’s new.  What we know about her is limited.  She made her first appearance and demonstration of her powers by way of a drawn out terrorism campaign against Cornell University.  Lung apparently recruited her and brought her to Brockton Bay after her plans were foiled by the New York Protectorate.  This is… something of a concern.”\r\n\r\n“What are her powers?”\r\n\r\n“Are you aware of the Tinker classification?”\r\n\r\nI started to shrug, but remembered my sore shoulder and nodded instead.  It was probably more polite, too.  I said, “Covers anyone with powers that give them an advanced grasp of science.  Lets them make technology years ahead of its time.  Ray guns, ice blasters, mechanized suits of armor, advanced computers.”\r\n\r\n“Close enough,” Armsmaster said.  It struck me he would be a Tinker, if his Halberd and armor were any indication.  That, or he got his stuff from someone else.  He elaborated,  “Well, most Tinkers have a specialty or a special trick.  Something they’re particualrly good at or something that they can do, which other Tinkers can’t.  Bakuda’s specialty is bombs.”\r\n\r\nI stared at him.  A woman with a power that let her make bombs that were technologically decades ahead of their time.  No wonder he saw it as a concern.\r\n\r\n“Now I want you to consider the danger involved in taking the credit for Lung’s capture.  Without a doubt, Oni Lee and Bakuda will be looking to accomplish two goals.  Freeing their boss and getting vengeance on the one responsible.  I suspect you’re now aware… these are scary people.  Scarier in some ways than their boss.”\r\n\r\n“You’re saying I shouldn’t take the credit,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I’m saying you have two options.  Option one is to join the Wards, where you’ll have support and protection in the event of an altercation.  Option two is to keep your head down.  Don’t take the credit.  Fly under the radar.”\r\n\r\nI wasn’t prepared to make a decision like that.  Usually, I went to sleep at eleven or so, waking up at six thirty to get ready for my morning run.  At my best guess, it was somewhere between one and two in the morning.  I was emotionally exhausted from the highs and lows of the evening, and I could barely wrap my head around the complications and headaches that would come from joining the Wards, let alone having two insanely dangerous sociopaths coming after me.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, I wasn’t so ignorant as to miss Armsmaster’s motives.  If I opted to not take the credit for Lung’s capture, Armsmaster would, I was sure.  I didn’t want to get on the bad side of a major player.\r\n\r\n“Please keep my involvement in Lung’s capture secret,” I told him, painfully disappointed to have to say it, even as I knew it made the most sense.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, which I hadn’t expected.  He had a nice smile.  It made me think that he could win the hearts of a lot of women, whatever the top two-thirds of his face looked like.  “I think you’ll look back and see this was a smart decision,” Armsmaster said, turning to walk to the other end of the roof, “Call me at the PHQ if you’re ever in a pinch.”  He stepped off the edge of the roof and dropped out of sight.\r\n\r\nCall me if you’re ever in a pinch.  He’d been saying, without openly admitting, that he owed me one.  He would take the lion’s share of the credit for Lung’s capture, but he owed me one.\r\n\r\nBefore I was all the way down the fire escape, I heard the thrum of his motorcycle, presumably carrying Lung towards a life of confinement.  I could hope.\r\n\r\nIt would take me a half hour to get home.  On the way, I would stop and pull on the sweatshirt and jeans I had hidden.  I knew my dad went to sleep even earlier than I did, and he slept like a log, so I had nothing to worry about as far as wrapping up the night.\r\n\r\nIt could have gone worse.  Strange as it sounds, those words were a  security blanket I wrapped around myself to keep myself from dwelling on the fact that tomorrow was a school day.'),

So, we do the best we can with the knucklebones we’ve been given. One of those bones is we’re pretty free to pick our skills. Men get lots of skills to help with their profession, but we’re not seen as good enough to be potters or cobblers. We’re just expected to stay home, and support our husbands.” A bitter look crossed mom’s face. Whoa. Where was all of this coming from? Mom, a staunch feminist? From everything I had seen so far, it seemed like she had completely bought into the system. That illusion was rapidly being pulled away from me.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t like I was an unrepentant troublemaker who caused chaos at every opportunity. Not like how Lyra was.\r\n\r\n“What we can do though, is pick our skills. We can work together. We can support each other. We all have some influence over our husbands. Some more than others. Senator Saturio, for example, is mostly just a figurehead for his wife, Venus, who holds all of the real power. The shame is, as amazing of a woman that she is, she’s not allowed to be the Senator. It has to be Saturio. And if they ever got in a real fight, Saturio would still win.”\r\n\r\nMy flycatcher was rapidly expanding in size, my lower jaw about to become intimately familiar with the ground.\r\n\r\n“That’s why I was putting such a strong emphasis on social skills for you. The only real power you’re going to have, the only way you’ll be able to navigate through society, is with social skills, with interacting with others, with keeping your head down and making the small changes and influences that you can. Otherwise the Republic will eat you up and spit you out again, and I don’t want to see that happen to you, my sweet baby girl.” She reached out with a single delicate finger, closing my jaw. My muscles didn’t engage as she released her finger, jaw dropping right back open.\r\n\r\n\"First off, you should take [Vigilant]. You’ve never been all that social, and with your social graces, I suspect you’re going to run into problems. I’m going to make sure you can see them coming. Second, you seem to like helping me out when I’m healing someone, right?”\r\n\r\nHealing Lyra had unlocked new feelings and emotions. I wanted to be a healer like mom. I wanted to make people better, to see their happy faces. I wanted to use that little bit of extra knowledge I had. I nodded briskly. Yeah, I could happily make this my choice.\r\n\r\n“Then take [First Aid] and [Anatomy] as well. Chores are easy, medicine is hard – let’s get you some skills in it. It will help you select your first class, if we decide on you taking [Healer].” I nodded, then realized.\r\n\r\n[Vigilant: You’re constantly on guard for trouble, aware of your surroundings at all times. Increased perception and awareness per level. -3 Mana Regeneration.]\r\n\r\n[First Aid: You’ve responded to injuries soon after they’ve occurred, and patched people up. Increased knowledge and dexterity when responding to injuries. -3 Mana Regeneration when in-use.]\r\n\r\n[Anatomy: You have fantastic knowledge of the human body, but it’s surface-level. Increased knowledge and learning of Anatomy per level. -4 Mana Regeneration.]\r\n\r\n“Hey wait, that’s three skills? Weren’t you only supposed to do two?”\r\n\r\nMom gave me a Look. Ack, talking back was going to get me killed one day. No spoon though.\r\n\r\n“One, we’re getting rid of [Cleaning]. That gives me an extra slot to work with. Two, I could dictate everything you pick. Three, you wanted [First Aid]. So no more back-talk from you.” I sheepishly nodded my head. Aye-Aye captain. Your wish is my command.\r\n\r\n“So now let’s work on the three skills you pick for yourself. Two questions to ask yourself. First: Does anything really call to you? Does anything speak to you, speak to your soul? Second: What do you want to do with yourself? How do you see yourself going through life? If you’re not sure, that’s OK. It’s a lot to ask of you. You can stay without classing up for a while if you’d like while you work it out. You can also drop skills and pick up new ones, but that resets everything back to one.”\r\n\r\nOoof, that was heavy stuff. No wonder I wasn’t told much before today, but at the same time, I should’ve been given time to think about this.\r\n\r\n[Running] spoke to me. I loved the movement, the freedom it brought, the wind in my hair. There was clearly a demand for it, the courier showed, and maybe there was room for a discreet woman running packages and messages around for wealthy women, or someone like Senator Saturio’s wife. There was potential there.\r\n\r\n[Running – You love the feel of motion and movement, wind wrapped around you. Increased speed per level while running. Costs 3 Mana per minute in-use.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day though, there was just a pure love for running and movement. What was life without things to do that you enjoyed? There was a call to [Running], and I decided I would be taking it.\r\n\r\n[Pretty] caught my eye, and I remembered some of the advice given. Given a choice, a chance to easily be better-looking through magical means, and the freedom to do so, who wouldn’t want something similar? From my earlier conversations, it seemed like this was a fairly normal skill to pick, and mom had made no comments on it. Screw it. I wanted to be [Pretty].\r\n\r\nI could grab [Clean Wounds] or [Bandaging], but I suspected it wouldn’t do much for me. Reviewing my list of options, something caught my eye I had missed last time. [Learning]. Education was the most powerful force I knew of, and while I hadn’t thought much of my past life recently, I remember a burning drive to KNOW, to learn things. That was why I wanted to learn how to read so badly. That was why I was disappointed to see no [Reading] skill. What did [Learning] do?\r\n\r\n[Learning: You have a passion, a drive for knowing more. You constantly seek out new knowledge, and have acquired considerable amounts of it. Easier to learn new ideas. Easier to learn new skills. Each level comes with a 1% increase in exp for all other skills and classes. -5 Mana Regeneration]\r\n\r\nThat sounded both useful and useless. Useless in that it didn’t do anything directly. It didn’t even impact other skills directly! The indirect effects, with everything else becoming more powerful – that sounded good. I focused on all of the skills, and was rewarded with a flurry of notifications.\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Congratulations! You’ve learned [Pretty] – level 1!]\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Congratulations! You’ve learned [Vigilant] – level 1!]\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Congratulations! You’ve learned [First Aid] – level 1!]\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Congratulations!

You’ve learned [Learning] – level 1!]\r\n\r\n“Now remember Elaine, your stats and skills are secret. We’ll do our best to help you out, but dad thinks you have [Cleaning] when you don’t, so make sure you don’t run your mouth about it.”\r\n\r\nLayers and layers of secrets, sheesh. At this rate I was going to get a ski-\r\n\r\n[*ding!* You’ve unlocked the Passive skill [Secrets]!]\r\n\r\n[Alert: You already have 8 general skills. Remove a skill for [Secrets]?]\r\n\r\nDid… did the System just pluck what I was thinking out of my head, and respond with a skill? Was I just sassed by the System? Could I just will myself to get other skills? I declined to pick up [Secrets], opened my stats and reviewed after all my changes:\r\n\r\n[Name: Elaine]\r\n\r\n[Race: Human]\r\n\r\n[Age: 8]\r\n\r\n[Mana (Regeneration)] 20/20 (8)\r\n\r\n[Class 1: [Child of Earth] +]\r\n\r\n[Class skills not available for initial Classes]\r\n\r\n[Class 2: Locked]\r\n\r\n[Class 3: Locked]\r\n\r\nGeneral Skills:\r\n\r\nActive - [Identify] – Lv 2\r\n\r\nActive - [Knives] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nPassive - [Pretty] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nPassive - [Vigilant] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nActive - [First Aid] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nPassive - [Anatomy] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nActive - [Running] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nPassive - [Learning] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nStats:\r\n\r\n[Free Stats: 32]\r\n\r\n[Strength: 4]\r\n\r\n[Dexterity: 6]\r\n\r\n[Vitality: 3]\r\n\r\n[Speed: 4]\r\n\r\n[Mana: 2]\r\n\r\n[Mana Regeneration: 2]\r\n\r\n[Magic Power: 2]\r\n\r\n[Magic Control: 10]\r\n\r\nI focused hard on learning [Fireball].\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nGuess it wasn’t going to be that easy.\r\n\r\n');

('Good Morning Brother', 'Mother of Learning', 1, 'Zorian’s eyes abruptly shot open as a sharp pain erupted from his stomach. His whole body convulsed, buckling against the object that fell on him, and suddenly he was wide awake, not a trace of drowsiness in his mind.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, brother!” an annoyingly cheerful voice sounded right on top of him. “Morning, morning, MORNING!!!”\r\n\r\nZorian glared at his little sister, but she just smiled back at him cheekily, still sprawled across his stomach. She was humming to herself in obvious satisfaction, kicking her feet playfully in the air as she studied the giant world map Zorian had tacked to the wall next to his bed. Or rather, pretended to study – Zorian could see her watching him intently out of the corner of her eyes for a reaction.\r\n\r\nThis was what he got for not arcane-locking the door and setting up a basic alarm perimeter around his bed.\r\n\r\n“Get off,” he told her in the calmest voice he could muster.\r\n\r\n“Mom said to wake you up,” she said matter-of-factly, not budging from her spot.\r\n\r\n“Not like this, she didn’t,” Zorian grumbled, swallowing his irritation and patiently waiting till she dropped her guard. Predictably, Kirielle grew visibly agitated after only a few moments of this pretend disinterest. Just before she could blow up, Zorian quickly grasped her legs and chest and flipped her over the edge of the bed. She fell to the floor with a thud and an indignant yelp, and Zorian quickly jumped to his feet to better respond to any violence she might decide to retaliate with. He glanced down on her and sniffed disdainfully. “I’ll be sure to remember this the next time I’m asked to wake you up.”\r\n\r\n“Fat chance of that,” she retorted defiantly. “You always sleep longer than I do.”\r\n\r\nZorian simply sighed in defeat. Damn the little imp, but she was right about that.\r\n\r\n“So…” she began excitedly, jumping to her feet, “are you excited?”\r\n\r\nZorian watched her for a moment as she bounced around his room like a monkey on caffeine. Sometimes he wished he had some of that boundless energy of hers. But only some.\r\n\r\n“About what?” Zorian asked innocently, feigning ignorance. He knew what she meant, of course, but constantly asking obvious questions was the fastest way of frustrating his little sister into dropping a conversation he’d rather not have.\r\n\r\n“Going back to academy!” she whined, clearly aware of what he was doing. He needed to learn some new tricks. “Learning magic. Can you show me some magic?”\r\n\r\nZorian let out a long-suffering sigh. Kirielle had always treated him as something of a playmate of hers, despite him doing his best not to encourage her, but usually she remained within certain unspoken boundaries. She was downright impossible this year, though, and Mother was wholly unsympathetic to his pleas to rein her in. All he did was read all day long, she said, so it wasn’t as if he was doing anything important… Thankfully the summer break was over and he could finally get away from them all.\r\n\r\n“Kiri, I have to pack. Why don’t you go pester Fortov for a change?”\r\n\r\nShe scowled at him unhappily for a second and then perked up, as if remembering something, and quickly ran out of the room. Zorian’s eyes widened when he realized what she was up to a second too late.\r\n\r\n“No!” he yelled as he ran after her, only to have the bathroom door slammed into his face. He pounded on the door in frustration. “Damn it, Kiri! You had all the time in the world to go to the bathroom before I woke up!”\r\n\r\n“Sucks to be you,” was her only answer.\r\n\r\nAfter hurling a few choice curses at the door, Zorian stomped off back to his room to get dressed. She would be inside for ages, he was sure, if only to spite him.\r\n\r\nQuickly changing out of his pajamas and putting on his glasses, Zorian took a moment to look around his room. He was pleased to note Kirielle hadn’t rummaged through his stuff before waking him up. She had a very fuzzy notion of (other people’s) privacy.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t take Zorian long to pack – he had never really unpacked, to be honest, and would have gone back to Cyoria a week ago if he thought Mother would have allowed it. He was just packing his school supplies when he realized with irritation that some of his textbooks were missing. He could try a locator spell, but he was pretty sure he knew where they had ended up – Kirielle had a habit of taking them to her room, no matter how many times Zorian told her to keep her sticky little fingers away from them. Working on a hunch, he double-checked his writing supplies and, sure enough, found they had been greatly depleted.\r\n\r\nIt always happened – every time he came home, Kirielle would raid his school supplies. Putting aside the ethical problems inherent in breaking into your brother’s room in order to steal his things, what on earth was she doing with all those pencils and erasers? This time he specifically bought extras with his sister in mind, but it still wasn’t enough - he couldn’t find a single eraser in his drawer, and he bought a whole packet of them before coming home. Why Kirielle couldn’t simply ask Mother to buy her some books and pens of her own was never really clear to Zorian. She was the youngest, and the only daughter, so Mother was always happy to spoil her - the dolls she talked Mother into buying her were five times more expensive than a couple of books and a stack of pencils.\r\n\r\nIn any case, while Zorian had no delusions about ever seeing his writing supplies again, he really needed those textbooks. With that in mind, he marched off to his sister’s room, ignoring the ‘Keep out!’ warning on the door, and quickly found his missing books in their usual location – cunningly hidden under the bed, behind several conveniently placed stuffed animals.\r\n\r\nHis packing done, he went downstairs to eat something and see what Mother wanted from him.\r\n\r\nThough his family thought he simply liked to sleep in, Zorian actually had a reason for being a late riser. It meant he could eat his food in peace, as everyone else had already had their breakfast by then. Few things annoyed him more than someone trying to strike up a conversation while he was eating, and that was precisely the time when the rest of his family was most talkative. Unfortunately, Mother wasn’t willing to wait for him today, and immediately descended upon him when she saw him coming down. He didn’t even finish his descent down the stairs and she had already found something about him she didn’t like.\r\n\r\n“You don’t really intend to go out looking like that, do you?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong with this?” asked Zorian. He was wearing a plain brown outfit, little different from the ones other boys wore when they were going into the city. It seemed just fine to him.\r\n\r\n“You can’t go out looking like that,” his mother said with a long-suffering sigh. “What do you think people will say when they see you wearing that?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing?” Zorian tried.\r\n\r\n“Zorian, don’t be so difficult,” she snapped at him. “Our family is one of the pillars of this town. We’re under scrutiny every time we leave the house. I know you don’t care about such things, but appearances are important to a lot of people. You need to realize you’re not an island, and you can’t decide things as if you were alone in the world. You are a member of this family, and your actions inevitably reflect on our reputation. I will not let you embarrass me by looking like a common factory worker. Go back to your room and put on some proper attire.”\r\n\r\nZorian restrained himself from rolling his eyes just long enough to turn his back on her. Maybe her guilt trip would have been more effective if this was the first time she tried it on him. Still, it wasn’t worth the argument, so he changed into a pricier set of clothes. It was totally excessive, considering he’d be spending the whole day in the train, but his mother nodded approvingly when she saw him coming down the stairs. She had him turn and pose like a show animal for a while before pronouncing him ‘fairly decent’. He went to the kitchen and, to his annoyance, Mother followed after him. No eating in peace today, it seemed.\r\n\r\nFather was thankfully on one of his \'business trips\', so he wouldn\'t have to deal with him today.\r\n\r\nHe entered the kitchen and frowned when he saw a bowl of porridge already waiting for him on the table. Usually he made his own breakfast, and he liked it that way, but he knew his mother never accepted that. This was her idea of a peace gesture, which meant she was going to ask something of him he wouldn’t like.\r\n\r\n“I figured I’d prepare something for you today, and I know you’ve always liked porridge,” she said. Zorian refrained from mentioning he hadn’t liked it since he was about eight. “You slept longer than I thought you would, though. It\'s gone cold while I\'ve waited for you.”\r\n\r\nZorian rolled his eyes and cast a slightly modified ‘heat water’ spell on the porridge, which was instantly returned to a pleasant temperature.\r\n\r\nHe ate his breakfast in silence while Mother talked to him at length about a crop-related dispute one of their suppliers was involved in, dancing around whatever topic she wanted to broach. He effortlessly tuned her out. It was practically a survival skill for every child in the Kazinski family, as both mother and father were prone to protracted lectures on every subject imaginable, but doubly so for Zorian, who was the black sheep of the family and thus subjected to such monologues more frequently than the rest. Thankfully, his mother thought nothing of his silence, because Zorian was always as silent as possible around his family – he had learned many years ago that this was the easiest way of getting along with them.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” he interrupted her, “I just woke up via Kiri jumping on me, I haven’t had a chance to go to the bathroom and now you’re pestering me while I’m eating. Either get to the point or wait a couple of minutes while I finish breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“She did it again?” his mother asked, amusement obvious in her voice.\r\n\r\nZorian rubbed his eyes, not saying anything, before surreptitiously pocketing an apple from the bowl on the table while his mother wasn’t looking. There were a lot of annoying things Kirielle did again and again, but complaining about it to Mother was a waste of time. No one in this family was on his side.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t be like that,” his mother said, noticing his less-than-pleased reaction. “She’s just bored and playing with you. You take things way too seriously, just like your father.”\r\n\r\n“I am nothing like my father!” Zorian insisted, raising his voice and glaring at her. This was why he hated eating with other people. He returned to his breakfast with renewed vigor, eager to finish this as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n“Of course you’re not,” Mother said airily, before suddenly switching the subject. “Actually, this reminds me of something. Your father and I are going to Koth to visit Daimen.”\r\n\r\nZorian bit the spoon in his mouth to prevent himself from making a snide comment. It was always Daimen this, Daimen that. There were days when Zorian wondered why his parents had three other children when they were clearly so enamored of their eldest son. Really, going to another continent just to visit him? What, were they going to die if they didn’t see him for a year?\r\n\r\n“What’s that got to do with me?” Zorian asked.\r\n\r\n“It will be an extended visit,” she said. “We’ll be there for about six months, most of it spent traveling from one place to another. You and Fortov will be at the academy, of course, but I’m worried about Kirielle. She’s only nine and I don’t feel comfortable bringing her along with us.”\r\n\r\nZorian paled, finally catching on to what she wanted of him. Hell. No.\r\n\r\n“Mother, I’m 15,” he protested.\r\n\r\n“So?” she asked. “Your father and I were already married when we were your age.”\r\n\r\n“Times change. Besides, I spend most of the day at the academy,” Zorian responded. “Why don’t you ask Fortov to take care of her? He’s a year older and he has his own apartment.”\r\n\r\n“Fortov is in his fourth year,” his mother said sternly. “He’s going to graduate this year so he has to focus on his grades.”\r\n\r\n\"You mean he said no,\" Zorian concluded out loud.\r\n\r\n“And besides…” she continued, ignoring his remark, “I’m sure you’re aware of how irresponsible Fortov can be at times. I don’t think he’s fit to raise a little girl.”\r\n\r\n“And whose fault is that?” Zorian grumbled quietly, loudly dropping his spoon and pushing the plate away from him. Maybe Fortov was irresponsible because he knew mother and father would simply dump his responsibilities onto Zorian if he just played dumb long enough, didn’t that ever occur to her? Why did it always fall to him to deal with the little imp? Well, he wasn’t going to get saddled with this! If Fortov was too good to take care of Kirielle, then so was Zorian!\r\n\r\nPlus, the little tattletale would undoubtedly report everything he did back to Mother without a second thought. The best thing about attending a school so far from home was that he could do whatever he wanted with his family being none the wiser, and there was no way he was going to give that up. Really, this was just a transparent ploy by his mother to spy on him, so she could lecture him some more about family pride and proper manners.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I’m fit for that either,” continued Zorian a little louder. “You said only a few minutes ago that I’m an embarrassment to the family. We wouldn’t want to corrupt little Kiri with my uncaring attitude, now would we?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t-“\r\n\r\n“No!” Zorian shouted.\r\n\r\n“Oh, have it your way,” she huffed in resignation. “But really, I wasn’t suggesting-“\r\n\r\n“What are you talking about?” Kirielle called out from behind him.\r\n\r\n“We were discussing what a rotten brat you are,” Zorian shot back immediately.\r\n\r\n“No you weren’t!”\r\n\r\nZorian just rolled his eyes and rose from his seat, intending to go to the bathroom, only to find an irate little sister blocking his path. There was a knock at the door.\r\n\r\n“I’ll get it!” said Zorian quickly, knowing that Mother would demand that one of them open the door and that Kirielle wouldn’t budge from her spot any time soon - she could be very stubborn when she wanted.\r\n\r\nThat was how Zorian found himself staring at a bespectacled woman dressed in expensive-looking khaki-colored clothes and cradling a thick book in her arm.\r\n\r\nThe woman gave him an appraising glance, adjusting her glasses. “Zorian Kazinski?”\r\n\r\n“Uh, yeah?” he said, unsure how to react to this development.\r\n\r\n“I am Ilsa Zileti, from Cyoria’s Royal Academy of Magical Arts. I’m here to discuss the results of your certification.”\r\n\r\nColor drained from Zorian’s face. They sent an actual mage to talk to him!? What did he do to warrant this!? Mother was going to skin him alive!\r\n\r\n“You aren’t in trouble, Mister Kazinski,” she said, smiling in amusement. “The Academy has a habit of sending a representative to third year students to discuss various matters of interest. I confess I should have visited you sooner, but I have been a tad busy this year. You have my apologies.”\r\n\r\nZorian stared at her for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n“May I come in?”\r\n\r\n“Huh? Oh!” said Zorian. “Forgive my manners, Miss Zileti. Come in, come in.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she accepted politely, stepping into the house.\r\n\r\nAfter a quick introduction to his mother and sister, Ilsa asked him if he had somewhere they could discuss school matters privately. Mother quickly decided she had to go to town market and took Kirielle with her, leaving him alone in the house with the mage, who promptly scattered various papers across the kitchen desk.\r\n\r\n“So, Zorian,” she began. “You already know you passed the certification.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I got the written notice,” Zorian said. “Cirin doesn’t have a mage tower, so I was going to pick up the badge when I got back to Cyoria.”\r\n\r\nIlsa simply handed him a sealed scroll. Zorian inspected the scroll for a few seconds and then tried to break the seal so he could read it. Unfortunately, the seal was quite tough to break. Unnaturally so, even.\r\n\r\nHe frowned. Ilsa wouldn’t have given him the scroll like this if she didn’t think he had the ability to open it. A test of some sort? He wasn’t anyone terribly special, so this would have to be something pretty easy. What skill did every recently-minted mage possess that would…\r\n\r\nOh. He almost rolled his eyes when he realized what this was all about. He channeled some mana into the seal and it promptly snapped itself in half, allowing Zorian to finally unroll the scroll. It was written in very neat calligraphy and appeared to be some kind of proof of his identity as a first circle mage. He glanced back at Ilsa, who nodded approvingly, confirming to Zorian that he had just passed a test of some sort.\r\n\r\n“You don’t really have to pick up your badge until you finish school,” she said. “The badge is pretty expensive and nobody is really going to bother you about it unless you plan to open a shop or otherwise sell your magical expertise. If they do bother you for whatever reason, just refer them to the academy and we’ll clear things up.”\r\n\r\nZorian shrugged. While he did intend to break away from his family, he’d prefer to wait until graduation, and that was two years away. He motioned on for her to continue.\r\n\r\n“Very well, then. The records say you lived in the academy housing for the past two years. I assume you intend to continue?”\r\n\r\nZorian nodded and she reached into one of her pockets and handed him a rather strange key. Zorian knew how locks in general worked, and could even pick simpler ones with enough time, but he couldn’t figure out how this key was supposed to work – it had no ‘teeth’ to fit in with the tumblers inside the lock. On a hunch, he channeled some mana into it, and faint golden lines immediately lit across the surface of the metal. He looked at Ilsa in a silent question.\r\n\r\n“Housing for third years works differently than you are used to,” she told him. “As you’re likely aware, now that you are a certified first circle mage, the academy is authorized to teach you spells of the first circle and above. Since you’ll be handling sensitive material, greater security is required, so you’ll be moving into a different building. The lock on your door is keyed to your mana, so you’ll have to channel some of your personal mana into the key like you did just now before it will unlock.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Zorian. Idly he spun the key in his hand, wondering how exactly they got a hold of his mana signature. Something to research later, he supposed.\r\n\r\n“Normally I would be explaining to you in detail what it means to be a third year student at Cyoria’s magical academy, but I hear you have a train leaving soon, so why don’t we jump straight to the main reason I’m here: your mentor and electives. You can ask me anything you wish to know afterwards.”\r\n\r\nZorian perked up on this, especially the mention of ‘mentor’. Each third year was given a mentor that they met with once a week, who was supposed to teach students in ways not possible in a standard class format, and otherwise help them reach their maximum potential. A choice of one’s mentor could make or break one’s magical career and Zorian knew he had to choose carefully. Fortunately, he had asked around among older students to find out which ones were good and which ones were bad, so he figured he would at least be able to get an above-average one.\r\n\r\n“So which mentors can I choose from?” Zorian asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, actually, I’m afraid you can’t,” Ilsa said apologetically. “Like I said, I was supposed to get to you sooner. Unfortunately, all but one of the mentors have filled their quota of students at this point.”\r\n\r\nZorian had a bad feeling about this… “And this mentor is?”\r\n\r\n“Xvim Chao.”\r\n\r\nZorian groaned, burying his face in his hands. Of all the teachers, Xvim was widely agreed upon as the worst mentor you could possibly get. It just had to be him, didn’t it?\r\n\r\n“It’s not that bad,” Ilsa assured him. “The rumors are mostly exaggerated, and mostly spread by students unwilling to do the kind of work Professor Xvim requires of his charges. I’m sure a talented, hard-working student such as yourself will have no problems with him.”\r\n\r\nZorian snorted. “I don’t suppose there is any chance to transfer to another mentor, is there?”\r\n\r\n“Not really. We’ve had a really good pass rate last year, and all of the mentors are swamped with students as it is. Professor Xvim is the least burdened of the available mentors.”\r\n\r\n“My, I wonder why,” Zorian mumbled. “Alright, fine. What about electives?”\r\n\r\nIlsa handed him another scroll, this one unsealed, containing a list of all elective classes offered by the academy. It was long. Very long. You could sign up for practically anything, even things that weren’t of strictly magical nature: things like advanced mathematics, classical literature, and architecture. It was to be expected, really, since Ikosian magical tradition had always been inextricably connected to other intellectual pursuits.\r\n\r\n“You can choose up to five, but no less than three electives this year. It would be a lot more convenient for us if you did it now, so that we can finalize the schedules over the weekend before the classes start. Don’t be too intimidated by the sheer size of the list. Even if you choose something that doesn’t appeal to you, you can switch to a different elective during the first month of school.”\r\n\r\nZorian frowned. There were a lot of electives and he wasn’t quite sure which ones he wanted to take. He\'d already gotten shafted in the mentor department, so he really couldn’t afford to screw up here. This would take a while.\r\n\r\n“Please don’t take this the wrong way Miss Zileti, but would you mind if we take a short break before we go any further with this?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” she said. “Is something the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” assured Zorian. “It’s just that I really need to go to the bathroom.”\r\n\r\nProbably not the best way to make a first impression. Kirielle was so going to pay for putting him in this position.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nZorian trailed after his family in silence as they entered Cirin’s train station, ignoring Fortov’s exuberant greeting of some ‘friends’ of his. He scanned the crowd on the train station for any familiar faces but, predictably, came out empty. He didn’t really know all that many people in his home town, as his parents loved reminding him. He felt his mother’s gaze on him as he unsuccessfully searched for an empty bench, but refused to look back at her – she would take that as permission to initiate conversation, and he already knew what she would say.\r\n\r\n‘Why don’t you join Fortov and his friends, Zorian?’\r\n\r\nBecause they’re immature jackasses, just like Fortov, that’s why.\r\n\r\nHe sighed, looking at the empty train tracks with annoyance. The train was late. He didn’t mind waiting as such, but waiting in the crowds was pure torture. His family would never understand, but Zorian hated crowds. It wasn’t any tangible thing, really – it was more like large gatherings of people projected some kind of presence that weighed down on him constantly. Most of the time it was annoying, though it did have its uses – his parents stopped taking him to church when they realized that dragging him into a small hall packed with people resulted in vertigo and fainting in a matter of minutes. Fortunately, the train station wasn’t currently crowded enough to produce such intense effects, but Zorian knew prolonged exposure would take its toll. He hoped the train wouldn’t take too long, because he didn’t relish spending the rest of the day with a headache.\r\n\r\nFortov’s loud laughter broke him out of such gloomy musings. His older brother didn’t have such problems, that’s for sure. Like always, he was cheerful, sociable, and had a smile that could light up the world. The people he was surrounded with were clearly enthralled with him, and he stood out among them at first glance, despite having the same thin build that Zorian did. He just had that kind of presence around him. He was like Daimen in this way, only Daimen had actual skills to back up his charm.\r\n\r\nHe scoffed, shaking his head. Zorian didn’t know for sure how Fortov had been accepted into a supposedly elite institution like Cyoria’s magical academy, but he strongly suspected Father had greased a few palms to get Fortov in. It wasn’t that Fortov was stupid, so much as lazy and completely unable to focus on a task, no matter how critical. Not that most people knew that, of course – the boy was charming as hell, and very adept in sweeping his inadequacies under the metaphorical rug.\r\n\r\nHis father always joked that Fortov and Zorian each got a half of Daimen in them: Fortov got his charm, and Zorian his competence.\r\n\r\nZorian had never liked his father’s sense of humor.\r\n\r\nA whistle pierced the air, and the train entered the station with a high-pitched squeal of metal wheels braking against the tracks. The original trains were steam-powered machines that billowed smoke wherever they went and consumed unholy amounts of coal to keep going, but this one was powered by the newer techno-magic engines that consumed crystallized mana instead. Cleaner, cheaper, and required less maintenance. Zorian could actually feel the mana radiating off the train as he approached, though his ability to sense magic was too underdeveloped to tell him any details. He had always wanted to look around the engine room of one of these things but could never figure out a good way to approach the train operators.\r\n\r\nBut that was a thought for another time. He gave a brief goodbye to Mother and Kirielle and entered the train to find himself a seat. He intentionally chose an empty compartment, something that was surprisingly easy to find. Apparently, despite the gathered crowd, few of them would be taking this particular train.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, the train gave another ear-splitting whistle and began its long journey towards Cyoria.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp crackling sound, following by the sound of a bell ringing.\r\n\r\n“Now stopping in Korsa,” a disembodied voice echoed. A crackling sound again. “I repeat, now stopping in Korsa. Thank you.”\r\n\r\nThe speakers crackled one last time before turning silent.\r\n\r\nZorian released a long sigh of irritation and opened his eyes. He hated trains. The boredom, the heat, and the rhythmic thumping sounds all conspired to make him sleepy, but every time he finally drifted off to sleep he was rudely awoken by the station announcer. That this was the very purpose of that announcer – to wake up passengers who would sleep through their destination – was not lost on Zorian, but it was no less annoying because of it.\r\n\r\nHe looked through the window, only to see a train station like any other. In fact, it was completely identical to the previous five, down to the blue outline on the big white tablet saying ‘Korsa’. Apparently the station builders were working off some kind of template these days. Looking at the station platform they were stopping at, he could see a large crowd of people waiting to get on the train. Korsa was a major trading hub, and a lot of newly minted merchant families lived here, sending their children to Cyoria’s prestigious academy to become mages and mingle among children of other influential people. Zorian found himself wishing that none of his fellow students join him in his compartment, but he knew it was an idle dream – there were too many of them and his compartment was completely empty aside from him. He did all he could to make himself comfortable in his seat and closed his eyes again.\r\n\r\nThe first person to join him in his compartment was a chubby, glasses-wearing girl in a green turtleneck. She gave him a cursory glance and started reading a book in silence. Zorian would have been ecstatic with such an agreeable traveling companion, but soon enough a group of four other girls came in and took the remaining four seats for themselves. The newcomers were very loud and prone to giggling fits, and Zorian was sorely tempted to get up and find himself a new compartment to occupy. He spent the rest of the trip alternating between looking through the window at the endless fields they were passing and exchanging annoyed glances with the green-turtleneck girl, who seemed similarly irritated by the other girls’ antics.\r\n\r\nHe knew they were getting close to Cyoria when he could see trees on the horizon. There was only one city on this route that was this close to the great northern forest, and the trains otherwise avoided getting close to so infamous a place. Zorian picked up his bag and went to stand by the exit. The idea was to be among the first to disembark, and thus avoid the usual crowding that always occurred once they got to Cyoria, but he was too late – there was already a crowd at the exit when he approached. He leaned on the nearby window and waited, listening to animated conversation between three first year students beside him, who were talking excitedly amongst themselves about how they were going to start learning magic and whatnot. Boy, were they going to be disappointed – the first year was all theory, meditation exercises, and learning how to access your mana consistently.\r\n\r\n“Hey, you! You’re one of the upperclassmen, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\nZorian looked at the girl talking to him and suppressed a groan of irritation. He so did not want to talk to these people. He had been in the train since early morning, Mother had given him a nasty lecture because he hadn\'t offered Ilsa something to drink while she was in the house, and he was in no mood for anything.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you could describe me as such,” he said cautiously.\r\n\r\n“Can you show us any magic?” she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Zorian flatly. He wasn’t even lying. “The train is warded to disrupt mana shaping. They had problems with people starting fires and vandalizing compartments.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” the girl said, clearly disappointed. She frowned, like trying to figure something out. “Mana shaping?” she asked cautiously.\r\n\r\nZorian raised an eyebrow. “You don’t know what mana is?” She was first year, yes, but that was elementary. Anyone who went through elementary school should know at least that much.\r\n\r\n“Magic?” she tried lamely.\r\n\r\n“Ugh,” grunted Zorian. “The teachers would so fail you for that. No, it’s not magic. It’s what powers magic - the energy, the power, that a mage shapes into a magical effect. You’ll learn more about it in lectures, I guess. Bottom point is: no mana, no magic. And I can’t use any mana at the moment.”\r\n\r\nThis was misleading, but whatever. There was no way he was explaining things to some random stranger, especially since she should already know this stuff.\r\n\r\n“Um, okay. Sorry to bother you then.”\r\n\r\nWith a lot of squealing and steam-letting, the train stopped at Cyoria’s train station, and Zorian disembarked as fast as he could, pushing past the awed first-years staring at the sight before them.\r\n\r\nCyoria’s train station was huge, a fact made obvious by the fact that it was enclosed, making it look more like a giant tunnel. Actually, the station as a whole was even larger, because there were four more ‘tunnels’ like this one, plus all the support facilities. There was nothing like it anywhere in the world, and virtually everyone was stupefied the first time they saw it. Zorian was too, when he first disembarked here. The feeling of disorientation was amplified by the sheer number of people that went through this terminal, whether they were passengers going in and out of Cyoria, workers inspecting the train and unloading luggage, newsboys shouting headlines, or homeless people begging for some change. As far as he knew, this massive flow of people never really ceased, even at night, and this was a particularly busy day.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the giant clock hanging from the ceiling and, finding out he had plenty of time, bought himself some bread from the nearby bakery and then set course for Cyoria’s central plaza, intending to eat his newly acquired food while sitting on the edge of the fountain there. It was a nice place to relax.\r\n\r\nCyoria was a curious city. It was one of the most developed and largest cities in the world, which was at first glance strange, as Cyoria was dangerously close to monster-infested wilderness and wasn’t in a favorable trade location. What really catapulted it to prominence was the massive circular hole on the west side of the city – probably the most obvious Dungeon entrance ever and the only Rank 9 mana well known to exist. The absolutely massive quantities of mana gushing out from the underworld had made the spot an irresistible magnet for mages. The presence of such a huge number of mages made Cyoria unlike any other city on the continent, both in the culture of the people living there and, more obviously, in the architecture of the city itself. A lot of things that would be too impractical to build elsewhere were routinely done here, and it made for an inspiring sight if you could find a good spot to watch the city from.\r\n\r\nHe froze in his tracks when he noticed a swarm of rats staring at him from the bottom of the stairway he was about to descend. Their behavior was strange enough, but his heartbeat really sped up when he took notice of their heads. Was that… were their brains exposed!? He swallowed heavily and took a step back, slowly retreating from the stairwell before turning around and fleeing in a full sprint. He wasn’t sure what they were, but those were definitely not normal rats.\r\n\r\nHe supposed he shouldn’t be so shocked, though – a place like Cyoria attracted more than mages – magical creatures of all breeds found such places just as irresistible. He was just glad the rats didn’t pursue him, because he had nothing in the way of combat spells. The only spell he knew that could be used in a situation like this was the ‘spook animals’ spell, and he had no idea how effective that would have been against such clearly magical creatures.\r\n\r\nSomewhat shaken but still determined to get to the fountain, he tried to circle the rat gathering by going through the nearby park, but luck just wasn’t on his side today. He promptly ran into a little girl crying her eyes out on the bridge he had to cross, and it took him five minutes just to get her to calm down enough to find out what happened. He supposed he could have just pushed past her and left her there to cry, but not even he was that cold-hearted.\r\n\r\n“T-the b-bike!” she blurted out finally, hiccupping heavily. “It f-fell in!” she wailed.\r\n\r\nZorian blinked, trying to interpret what she was trying to tell him. Apparently realizing she wasn’t making any sense, the girl pointed towards the creek running underneath the bridge. Zorian looked over the edge of the bridge and, sure enough, there was a children’s bicycle half-submerged in the muddy waters.\r\n\r\n“Huh,” Zorian said. “Wonder how that happened?”\r\n\r\n“It fell in!” the girl repeated, looking as if she was going to cry again.\r\n\r\n“All right, all right, no need for waterworks, I’ll get it out okay?” Zorian said, eying the bicycle speculatively.\r\n\r\n“You’ll get dirty,” she warned quietly. Zorian could tell from her tone of voice that she hoped he would get it out anyway.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, I have no intention of wading through that mud,” Zorian said. “Watch.”\r\n\r\nHe made a few gestures and cast a ‘levitate object’ spell, causing the bike to jerkily rise out of the water and into the air. The bike was a lot heavier than the objects he usually practiced with, and he had to levitate the bike a lot higher than he was used to, but it was nothing outside his capabilities. He snatched the bike by its seat when it was close enough and placed it on the bridge.\r\n\r\n“There,” Zorian said. “It’s all muddy and wet but I can’t help you there. Don’t know any cleaning spells.”\r\n\r\n“O-Okay,” she nodded slowly, clutching her bicycle like it was going to fly out of her hand the moment she let go.\r\n\r\nHe bid her goodbye and left, deciding his relaxing time at the fountain just wasn’t meant to be. The weather seemed to be worsening pretty quickly too – dark clouds were brewing ominously across the horizon, heralding rain. He decided to simply join the diffuse line of students trudging towards the academy and be done with it.\r\n\r\nIt was a long way from the train station to the academy, since the station was on the outskirts of the city and the academy was right next to the Hole. Depending on how physically fit you were, and how much luggage you had to drag around, you could get there in an hour or two. Zorian wasn’t particularly fit, what with his skinny physique and shut-in ways, but he had purposely packed light in anticipation of this journey. He joined the procession of students that was still streaming from the train station in the direction of the academy, ignoring the occasional first year struggling with excessive baggage. He empathized with them because his asshole brothers didn’t warn him to keep the luggage at a minimum either and he was like them the first time he arrived at the train station, but there was nothing he could do to help them.\r\n\r\nThe threat of rain and bad luck aside, he felt invigorated as he drew closer to academy grounds. He was drawing on the ambient mana suffusing the area around the Hole, replenishing the mana reserves he spent levitating that girl’s bicycle. Mage academies are almost always built on top of mana wells for the express purpose of exploiting this effect – an area with such high ambient mana levels is a perfect place for inexperienced mages to practice their spellcasting. Anytime they run out of mana they can supplement their natural mana regeneration by replenishing their mana reserves from their very surroundings.\r\n\r\nZorian took out the apple he still carried in his pocket and levitated it over his palm. It wasn’t really a spell, so much as raw mana manipulation – a mana shaping exercise that was supposed to help mages improve their ability to control and direct magical energies. It looked like such a simple thing, but it took Zorian two years before he mastered it fully. Sometimes he wondered if his family was right and he really was too focused on his studies. He knew for a fact that most of his classmates had much more tenuous control over their magic, and it didn’t appear to be inhibiting them too much.\r\n\r\nHe dismissed the mana construct holding the apple in the air and let it fall down on his palm. He wished he had some kind of rain protection spell – the first drops of rain were already starting to fall. That, or an umbrella. Either would work just fine, except an umbrella didn’t require several years of training to use.\r\n\r\n“Magic can be such a rip-off at times,” said Zorian gloomily.\r\n\r\nHe took a deep breath and started running.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\n“Huh. So there is a rain protection spell,” mumbled Zorian as he watched raindrops splattering upon an invisible barrier in front of him. He extended his hand over the edge of the barrier, and it passed unimpeded. He withdrew his suddenly rather wet hand into the safety of the barrier and followed the boundary as far as his eyes could see. From what he could tell, the barrier encircled the entire academy compound (no small feat, as academy grounds were quite extensive) in a protective bubble that stopped the rain – and only rain - from penetrating it. Apparently the academy upgraded its wards again, because they didn’t have this feature the last time it was raining.\r\n\r\nShrugging, he turned around and continued towards the administration building of the academy. It was too bad the barrier didn’t also dry you out when you passed it, because he was soaking wet. Thankfully, his bag was waterproof, so his clothes and textbooks weren’t in any danger of getting ruined. Slowing down to a leisurely stroll, he studied the collection of buildings that made up the academy. The wards weren’t the only thing that was upgraded; the whole place looked… prettified, for a lack of a better term. Every building was freshly painted, the old brick road was replaced by a much more colorful one, the flower patches were in full bloom, and the small fountain that hadn’t worked for years was suddenly functional.\r\n\r\n“Wonder what that’s all about,” he mumbled.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes of contemplation, he decided he didn’t care much. He would find out sooner or later, if it was of any importance.\r\n\r\nThe administration building was, predictably, mostly empty of students. Most of them took shelter from the rain instead of pressing on like Zorian, and those that didn’t often didn’t live on academy grounds and thus had no reason to come here today. That was perfect as far as Zorian was concerned, as it meant he could be done here quickly.\r\n\r\n‘Quickly’ turned out to be a relative term – it took two hours of wrangling with the girl working at the administration desk before he had taken care of all the necessary paperwork. He asked about his class schedule, but was told it wasn’t finalized yet and that he would have to wait until Monday morning. Come to think of it, Ilsa had mentioned the same thing. Before he left, the girl gave him a book of rules with which third-year students were expected to familiarize themselves before sending him on his way. Zorian idly flipped through the rule book while he searched for room 115, before putting it into one of the more obscure compartments in his backpack, never to be looked at again.\r\n\r\nAcademy-provided housing was pretty terrible, and Zorian had had very unpleasant experiences with it, but it was free and apartment space was severely overpriced in Cyoria. Even children of nobles often lived on academy grounds rather than in their own apartments, so who was he to complain? Besides, living so close to the lecture hall cut down on the travel time each morning and put him close to the biggest library in the city, so there were definitely good sides to it.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, he smiled to himself as he entered a fairly spacious room. He was even more pleased when he realized he had his own bathroom. With a shower stall, no less! It was a welcome change from having to share a cramped little room with an inconsiderate roommate and sharing a single communal bathroom with the whole floor. As far as furniture went, the room had a bed, a closet, a set of drawers, a work desk, and a chair. Everything Zorian needed, really.\r\n\r\nDropping his luggage on the floor, Zorian changed out of his wet clothes before collapsing on the bed with relief. He had two whole days before the classes started, so he decided to postpone unpacking until tomorrow. Instead he remained motionless on the bed, wondering for a moment why he couldn’t hear the raindrops hitting the glass plane of the window next to his bed, before remembering the rain barrier.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got to learn how to cast that,” he mumbled.\r\n\r\nHis spell collection was extremely limited at the moment, consisting of about 20 simple spells, but he had plans to rectify that this year. As a certified first circle mage, he had access to parts of the academy library he didn’t before, and he planned on raiding them for spells contained within. Besides, this year’s classes were supposed to be much more focused on practical spellcasting now that they’d proven themselves capable, so he should be learning plenty of interesting things in class too.\r\n\r\nTired from the long journey, Zorian closed his eyes, intending to take a short nap. He wouldn’t wake up until tomorrow morning.');

('Grave', 'Cinnamon Bun', 8, 'I hit a rock. A spark flew out from the gardening trowel I was using. I grabbed the rock and tossed it aside and returned to digging.\r\n\r\nThe hole grew. Wet dirt stained my knees and seeped into my dress as I tore into the soggy ground.\r\n\r\nMy fingers began to hurt. I dug deeper.\r\n\r\nThe sun burned down onto my back. The hole was a few feet deep now. Not very even, not as deep as some. But enough.\r\n\r\nI lowered the package down, wrapped in the cloth of a banner I had found in the guard tower.\r\n\r\nI stared for a moment. The words were hard to find until a small smile broke out. “Rarr,” I said.\r\n\r\nDirt fell onto the grave, filling it. Then I patted it down.\r\n\r\nThe gravestone came next. A plaque made from a piece of a door, the stick holding it up once a spear that had saved my life.\r\n\r\nBonesy\r\nAn unnamed bard.\r\nA skeleton\r\nA friend\r\n\r\nI wiped my cheeks dry and got up.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe armour I had been so excited about slipped on easily enough. There were knots to tie, and the material pinched in a few places. But as soon as it was all on the material shifted and moved. I felt the faint stir of magic around my body, then nothing.\r\n\r\nIt fit like a glove.\r\n\r\nThat was good. I would need it.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThere were still only five ghosts. I had a long piece of cord by my side, the end heavy where I had tied my showerhead glyph. I held onto the small ‘magic wand’ in my other hand. I had a suspicion I wanted to prove.\r\n\r\nThe grass rustled and shifted as I walked closer to the church, to the graveyard. “Hey!” I called out.\r\n\r\nFive heads slowly turned my way, then their faces shifted into disgusting, disfigured expressions as if I had just walked over to them covered in rot and filth.\r\n\r\n“Hello,” I said. My voice was hoarse, a little raw. I blinked a few times, then coughed to clear my throat. “Hello. My name is Broccoli Bunch,” I said even as the first ghosts started to fly towards me, arms and claws outstretched.\r\n\r\n“W-would you be my friends?”\r\n\r\nThe first ghost to reach me grabbed my face, claws digging into the back of my head and cheek.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” I said.\r\n\r\nCleaning magic shot into the ghost.\r\n\r\nThe ghost burst apart.\r\n\r\nI swung my makeshift flail around in a tight circle, sweeping through the arms of the next ghost to approach again and again, but it was still coming at me.\r\n\r\nThe magic wand flew through its head and past the body of the ghost behind him. One fell, the other paused as the hole in its torso mended.\r\n\r\nI stepped to the side and shoved my hand into the chest of the next ghost. Another pulse of cleaning magic. Two were left. I was down to the last third of my mana.\r\n\r\nMy spinning flail spun through the already injured ghost as I moved onto the last and most intact of the group. A touch, a burst of mana. It burst apart like a sack of flour with a firecracker inside it.\r\n\r\nThen the flail did its job and the final ghost, already torn apart, whooshed onto the ground in a pool of dust. It left behind a thin, ghostly cloth.\r\n\r\nMy knees hit the ground and I buried my face in my hands. My tears stung when they slid into the open cuts across my cheek.\r\n\r\nBut I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t stay and just wallow in my own sadness. I had a quest, a mission to do, and being sad, being down like that, even if, even if I had just killed my only friend. I swallowed, throat thick.\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have wiped out (5) enemies (‘Sentinel Ghost of Threewells by Darkwood’ Level 1! x5)!\r\n\r\nDing! For repeating a Special Action a sufficient number of times you have unlocked the skill: Makeshift Weapon Proficiency!\r\n\r\n“Neat,” I said to no one, because there was no one to hear.\r\n\r\nI got up. I wiped my eyes again. I used the last of my mana to clean my face, wiping away the drying blood and allowing a fresh rivulet to slip down my cheek. One more cut and I would have an even number of scars across my cheeks. I snorted, which turned into a giggle, which I stopped before I started crying again.\r\n\r\nThe shops. The church. Then the evil spirit. Enough time to regain all of my mana and maybe eat some more honey and drink more lukewarm water.\r\n\r\nI picked up the ghostly cloth and brought it with me to the edge of the road where my haversack was waiting and tossed it in along with my magic wand. The showerhead I kept. Had to grind those Makeshift Weapon Proficiency levels after all. A gift, of sorts, from Bonesy.\r\n\r\nThe first stop was a general store, the shelves emptied, some of them tossed to the ground. There were jars here and there, and some lengths of rope that looked decent. I took one and looped it under one arm and over the opposite shoulder. It seemed sturdy enough, and good rope was never a bad thing.\r\n\r\nI found a backpack in the back of the store. It was dusty, of course, and a little brittle, but the material seemed nice and tough and hadn’t rotten away. I transferred the stuff from my haversack into it, leaving behind some of the less handy things and wrapping others in the cloth I had. I didn’t want to make too much noise as I moved, which meant quieting down the rattle of the stuff I carried.\r\n\r\nMy inventory, if I could call it that without sounding too geeky, consisted of:\r\nA now-empty haversack\r\nTwo pieces of ghostly cloth\r\nA key from the house with training dummies\r\nFour jars of honey\r\nOne jar of vinegar\r\nTwo bottles of wine\r\nA bottle of water from my showerhead\r\nOne pretty painting boat and dragon\r\nSome silverware in a cloth\r\nOne silver candleholder with a dozen fresh candles\r\nA small firestarter\r\nSome bits and pieces of cloth.\r\nA length of rope\r\nMy map\r\n\r\nNot much of a hoard, but enough, I hoped, to get by. I wondered where and when I had misplaced my rusty short sword. Not that it mattered much.\r\n\r\nThe next stop was the blacksmith’s shop. There was a bell that clunked above the door, just loud enough and close enough to my head that I jumped three feet in the air at the noise. “Oh gosh,” I said as my heart pounded away. I shook my head, made sure I was still alone in the shop, then started looking around.\r\n\r\nThis had to be the workspace of whoever lived in that one home I had found with the broken anvil. It was a busy place, with tools laying all over and strange devices left to rust. From the number of hooks on the wall and the tools around, it was clear that the blacksmith had taken his or her share of them with them. The anvil was gone, but there was a big log where it might have sat. The huge forge at the back had remained, probably easier to move the rest of the building than that one piece.\r\n\r\nI didn’t clean anything as I moved to a small section that seemed to be made for displaying wares and suchlike to the customers. There was a safe with a key resting in its lock.\r\n\r\n“Huh,” I said as I easily opened the door and found... ingots of metal and a few knives in leather sheaths. One man’s treasure, I guessed. None of the stuff within the safe was rusted, probably owing to the glyphs carved into the sides of the box.\r\n\r\nI pulled out one knife and sheath and inspected it visually, then ran a thumb perpendicular to the blade. It sang a little. Sharp.\r\n\r\n“Insight.”\r\n\r\nA sharp steel woodsman’s knife, old.\r\n\r\nI shrugged, tossed one knife into my backpack and looped the other to the belt holding up my leather skirt.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the shop didn’t reveal much of any worth to me.\r\n\r\nThe third store, the one nearest the gates of the village, had a strange sign above it. A staff with a ball above it and something going around it. Magic, obviously, but what sort was beyond me.\r\n\r\nThe door opened to a few quick kicks and revealed a sort of clinic, of all things. A pair of beds at the back, both with dirtied sheets on them stained with what might have been blood once. There was a counter with glass jars to one side, and beyond that a small room with mortar and pestles and alembics.\r\n\r\n“An alchemist’s shop,” I realized. “And a medical clinic.” It made sense that they would be together. I picked up a bottle and shook it a little. “Insight.”\r\n\r\nAn expired healing potion, old.\r\n\r\n“Shucks.” Not one of them was usable, much to my dismay. I left them behind and explored some more, but most of the good stuff had left with the people living here or had been looted long ago. The second floor of the building had a small bedroom for two and an office space with a strange cabinet on the wall. There were some more tools within, and a single book. All perfectly untouched.\r\n\r\nI recognized the glyphs from the safe on the inside of the cabinet. It was locked.\r\n\r\nSafe from time the contents might have been, but not from a smack from a rock. The glass burst apart, showering the floor in tinkling pieces that I shied away from. “Sorry,” I said to the no doubt long-dead owners as I moved to the cabinet. The book was fresh. Not quite new. In fact, it was worn and well loved.\r\n\r\nHerbs for Healing, Plants for Power, read the title.\r\n\r\n“Huh, neat,” I said. “Insight.”\r\n\r\nA herbology book.\r\n\r\nI leafed through the pages, taking note of the carefully hand-drawn images of plants on nearly every page and the obviously machine-printed text next to them with descriptions and warnings and uses. There were notes as well, in a cursive hand that was hard to read but still comprehensible if I squinted.\r\n\r\nI wrapped it in a bit of old bedsheets I cut off in the bedroom, then placed it in the bottom of my pack.\r\n\r\nThat was it. There were some homes left to explore, and the church, but that was it for this corner of the town. It was also it for me, at least for that day. The sun hadn’t begun to set yet, but I was tired, weary to the bone.\r\n\r\nI had one last thing I wanted to look into, then I would be off.\r\n\r\nThe town was as silent as ever as I crossed it. The only difference now that my head was held high and I welcomed any ghost that would come at me. None did. I reached the hole in the wall where I had first come out into Threewells and shuffled into it. My eyes lingered over where Bonesy had once been, but I moved on.\r\n\r\nIn the office was the chest I couldn’t open. In my hand, the key I had found in the house with the training dummies and spare swords. It was just a hunch, but... The key slotted in, and I spun it around. The lock clicked and the top of the chest popped open with a whump of pressurized air escaping.\r\n\r\nI opened the chest to find two binders filled with papers and a leather bandolier, all of its pockets empty.\r\n\r\nWell, it was there for the taking. I slipped off my leather jacket, then put on the bandolier so that it would be opposite the coil of rope I had, then I hiked the jacket back on and replaced the rope. There. Now I looked like... well, the gambeson made me look like a marshmallow. A marshmallow with a skirt and a leather jacket.\r\n\r\nI smiled faintly at the image I must have presented. Far from the competent explorer I hoped to be. Still, it was good enough for now.\r\n\r\nI picked through the binders absently. The pages within were mostly intact, but all of them seemed like dull reports.\r\n\r\nI took them anyway. I needed something to keep me company until morning.'),
('He Bravely Turned His Tail and Fled', 'Beware of Chicken', 1, 'Beware of Chicken\r\n\r\nIn which a transmigrator decides the only winning move is to get the hell out of dodge.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nLu Ri stared at the disciple. The boy had his arm in a sling, a black eye, and several other wounds marring his body. A quite pitiful sight, all told.\r\n\r\n“You wish to leave the sect?” He asked, repeating the disciples request..\r\n\r\n“Yes, Senior Brother,” The disciple said. “This Jin Rou’s abilities are lacking, and I was defeated by others two years my younger. I would leave before I bring greater shame upon this Cloudy Sword Sect.\"\r\n\r\nLu Ri nearly sighed. In all honesty, him being crushed by one of the inner disciples looking for someone to “practise” with was a forgone conclusion, even with the age difference. The elder disciple considered the brown haired boy. Indeed, Jin Rou was not powerful, but he was diligent, and always willing to tend to the less desirable tasks around the sect. Losing him for his attention to detail in caring for the compound and lowly spirit herbs would be a minor blow… but it was hardly anything that the sect would notice losing. The boy had no real training, or techniques of the sect yet either.\r\n\r\nAnd if this was enough to crush his spirit, and ask to leave… Then he was not meant to be a cultivator in the first place. This was no place for the weak of heart.\r\n\r\nAt least he was polite enough to formally go through with his leaving, instead of just disappearing. He was the first in over three hundred years to use such courtesies, and had even provided the sum that was his recompense to the sect for taking him in, as outlined in the proper documents. Lu Ri considered attempting to dissuade him from leaving… but he felt no tumult in the boy’s paltry Qi. His conviction was set.\r\n\r\n“What is your intent after leaving this place, Disciple?” he asked out of idle curiosity.\r\n\r\n“I shall become a farmer, Senior Brother,” The boy replied, “I had some luck in growing the lowly spiritual herbs, so such a thing should be within my minor talents.”\r\n\r\nLu Ri once more nearly spoke against it, at hearing this madness. A mere farmer, from a boy who, though barely, passed the first of their sect’s initiation? The devastating defeat must have completely demoralised him. Unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThis time he did sigh.\r\n\r\n“I see. I shall mark down your leaving. You are no longer a disciple of our sect, Jin Rou.”\r\n\r\nJin Rou bowed his head, and clasped his fist in front of him. “This Jin Rou thanks you for your time and consideration. I shall darken the compound’s halls no longer.”\r\n\r\nLu Ri stood, and inclined his head. “Then go into the world, Jin Rou.... and here.”\r\n\r\nHe held the pouch containing the severance money back out to him. “I shall mark it down as paid in full. Diligence and proper courtesy deserve some reward, and the sect does not need such a paltry sum.” It was probably all the money the boy had, anyway. He did have some kindness to him, and Jin Rou would need the luck of heaven in the future.\r\n\r\nJin Rou looked shocked, but again bowed his head in supplication.\r\n\r\n“May Heaven be kind to you, Lu Ri.”\r\n\r\nAnd then Jin Rou was gone from the sect.\r\n\r\nHis leaving went unnoticed.\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI came to in the middle of dear old Jinny-boy getting his ass beat by a stereotypical “young master” type.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you, that was horse shit. Jin was kind of an idiot for not getting out of the way in time when the little shit wanted to fuck somebody up, but at least there was no meridian destroying because “the commoner was so beneath him”.\r\n\r\nA few of the other disciples were kind enough to drag my twitching body back to my little room... and then ransacked some of the herbs as \"payment\".\r\n\r\nDicks.\r\n\r\nIt only really hit me that I was in magical china land while I was moaning in pain. Apparently one of the bodyshots had hit poor Jin hard enough, and in just the right way to stop his heart and kill him.\r\n\r\nAnd before he even fell over, I got shoved in. At least I got his memories, and how to actually use the remainder of this current batch of herbs to deal with the worst of the damage. Which is some mashing and grinding, which is extremely painful with how many injuries I have got.\r\n\r\nJin himself was fairly respectable, I suppose. He was an orphan, after his gramps disappeared, who managed to join a sect through hard work, kind of. His admittance was because one of the instructors flipped a coin when deciding his fate, because he just barely squeaked past. Said something about heaven favoring him or some shit.\r\n\r\nJin was full of wanting to become a powerful cultivator, a master among masters, and do whatever it is the dickbags who run this place do, which is presumably to be dicks, dickishly. I kinda... did not care about his motivations. My body now, buddy. Sorry, not sorry. Dear old Jin was essentially a servant right now anyway, and had to do every task that the other people offloaded onto him, while harboring vengeance and hate and angst.\r\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, I wanted none of that shit. I declare any revenge fantasies and ambitions null and void. I wanted none of the little fuckboy who wasted my ass. And most importantly, I wanted nothing to do with the politics of this world, because holy shit. Lots of line extinguishing, and murdering each other for face.\r\n\r\nYou know, standard xianxia stuff.\r\n\r\nSo I looked up the methods to leaving the sect when I was mobile the next day, grabbed one of Jin’s pouches of money, and went to the guy in charge of this kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t expecting to get the money pouch back, but I was fine with losing that one. Jin was actually fairly good at saving: He had been saving to purchase a few spiritual pills, after picking up so many extra chores.\r\n\r\nBut what was his is now mine. And I’m getting the fuck out of here, and far away from all the sword formations and Grand demonic dick punches or whatever the fuck these chuuni bastards spout.\r\n\r\nSo I started travelling to the Azure Hills. Which was regarded as the weakest, and therefore safest place on the continent.\r\n\r\nHopefully anyways. Cultivators usually cleared out of “weak” places pretty quick.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nI smiled down at my new plot of land. It was a few rolling hills, covered by a forest, and had a lovely little river winding through it. It was fantastically picturesque, as were most places in the Red Phoenix Continent.\r\n\r\nThe land was considered largely useless by the Magistrate of the town, as there were some minor monsters around, and it needed lots of clearing, but hopefully nothing I couldn’t handle.\r\n\r\nIt was also extremely cheap. I had got this place for a steal. Man, fuck property prices back home, this is where its at. I had considered the possibility I had been fucked over, and asked the locals about this place, but nope. No sleeping big bad dudes, as far as anyone new. Just out of the way and more trouble than it was worth.\r\n\r\nPeople rarely came down this way too, as far as it was from the town, and the surrounding villages. Nobody to bother me here. Just peace.\r\n\r\nI breathed in the fantastically clean and invigorating air, and shook my head. Enough lazing around. I reached into my wagon and grabbed my axe, causing my chickens to cluck irritatedly at me and the young rooster to crow at the sudden jostling.\r\n\r\nI gave him a little scratch under his developing wattles, and he calmed.\r\n\r\nWell, time to get to work. Operation “No Cultivator Bullshit\" is go!\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nTheres a certain sort of zen you reach when you engage in heavy physical activity for long enough. My axe hewed through trees, My saw made planks, my hammer drove in nails, and my plane made things level, fueled by the supernatural strength of cultivator, even if I was an exceptionally weak one. It was calming and invigorating at the same time, and I must confess I heartily enjoyed the heavy physical labour and the strength of ten men. My breathing was a perfect rhythm, and my qi circulated around me. I felt so invigorated and refreshed!\r\n\r\nThat, and being able to tear a stump out of the ground with nothing but brute strength would never get old.\r\n\r\nMy first home was a simple, one room affair, built within the first three days. It wasn’t anything spectacular, but it would keep the elements off me, and the bugs at bay, with it is thatch roof and pounded dirt floor. It was right against my chicken coop, so I could hear if there were any predatory interlopers during the night, but the foxes and the wolves had yet to notice my intrusion, and the prey animals that I had.\r\n\r\nI was proud of what I had built.\r\n\r\nI woke with the call of my rooster, who I had named Big D. An incredibly childish name, I confess, but it amused me greatly. My young lad would follow me around during the day, hopping around, and often sitting on my shoulder, and proclaiming his dominance to the world, the cheeky shit.\r\n\r\n“Cock-a-doddle-doo!” He’d screech.\r\n\r\n“You tell ‘em Big D.” I’d reply.\r\n\r\nMy hoe bit the earth and never dulled, reinforced as it was by my qi, tearing into it with more speed than any ox could generate. My chickens eagerly followed behind me, pecking the bugs and plants I unearthed with my efforts, bucking and clucking all the way.\r\n\r\nYes, get good and fat my pretties, and you will be delectable in the future.\r\n\r\nAh, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.\r\n\r\nUp and down went the hoe, up and down went the hoe, until I noticed something. A strange root poked out, and had a faint sense of qi about it. Interested, I picked up the lumpy, and slightly nondescript root.\r\n\r\nIn xianxia novels, this is where the protagonist would immediately identify the plant, spouting that it was some rare so and so root of six elixirs or something, but quite frankly, I had no fucking clue what it was. I’d have to go to the town Archive at some point, but considering it was here, it probably wasn’t very rare or important.\r\n\r\nShrugging, I put it into my house, and got back to work. After this field, which was going to be my vegetable garden, I’d start on the rice paddy. It sucks that I have not been able to get any wheat yet, but whatcha gonna do?\r\n\r\n//////\r\n\r\nThat night, I had an absolutely delicious egg fried rice, with Big D sitting on my shoulder. Maybe it was a little morbid, to eat eggs right near your pet chicken, but he didn’t seem to mind. Eggs from my chickens, rice from my reserves, some sesame oil that I had splurged on when I bought my land… and some of the leftover Lowly Spiritual Herbs I had uh, liberated from the Cloudy whatever sect. They tasted pretty damn good. A little spicy, a little sweet, a little savoury-- I’d definitely have to grow more of them. They weren’t that hard to grow from Jin’s memories. I’d just have to baby them for a bit.\r\n\r\nSure, I could convert them into pills, but I was extremely suspect about all the pills these people choked back. I’m half convinced the reason every cultivator is so damn nuts is because of all drugs they did.\r\n\r\nI shook myself out of my introspection and tuned to the pleased clucking sounds coming from my “kitchen.” Big D was eagerly pecking at the little nubs of spirit herb I had cut off that looked a bit wilted.\r\n\r\nThey probably wouldn’t kill him. Never heard of something dying from eating these things before.\r\n\r\nEh, if he likes ‘em, he likes ‘em. Not going to deny the little man his food.\r\n\r\nSoon enough, I got into my bed, with Big D jumping up onto the perch I made him by the window.\r\n\r\nMan, If I was still in the sect, I would be doing shitty chores, or sitting in a corner cultivating for months on end, instead of actually making stuff.\r\n\r\nI went to sleep happy and content with my life choices.'),
('Hole in the Ground', 'There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.', 10, 'Delta watched as Francois brought the bucket of mushrooms for Bacon. Delta grumbled as she flicked through her menus looking for some way to turn the damn fungi growths off. She was the Dungeon Core; she should have the authority to do it.\r\n\r\nIf she could just find the right screen or option. Delta, having no other option, just kept feeding them to Bacon to stop them occupying every little corner and wall. The only place they didn’t seem to grow as the spider room and Delta was not poking around in there to look for any reason why.\r\n\r\nHob and Gob would be returning back soon with their bounty. Their last haul had some interesting results. Namely that while Delta asked for fish, the goblins had brought back crayfish. There was something fishy about that but the goblins didn\'t seem to see the problem. As far as Delta knew, crayfish didn’t live in forest ponds or lakes…\r\n\r\nOr did they? Delta didn’t even know where the nearest source of water was… Maybe there was an ocean just around the river bend?\r\n\r\nTo be honest, what she knew about crayfish could fit in a fortune cookie.\r\n\r\nOr maybe they did via magic now? Delta pondered the idea of crayfish just living wherever they damn well pleased in this world. Terrifying, but power to them. Having a few dissolved in her dungeon gave more than a pleasing result, along with more mana, rocks and berries.\r\n\r\n    Crayclaw has been unlocked in the monster purchase menu!\r\n\r\n    Crayclaw: 10 DP. A large arthropod monster that lives in water. About the size of an average cat and its right oversized pincher it uses to remove fingers and tear food apart. Requires water features present in dungeon to summon.\r\n\r\nA new monster was always a potential goldmine. Why she got the ability to summon the Crayclaw and not boars from the pig was a question she kinda wanted to be answered, but Delta let it go when all she had was theories and guesses.\r\n\r\nThe water part made sense; Delta could even see how such a requirement was not really asking much.\r\n\r\nDid you get crayfish? Great, now don’t be an idiot and scoop up some of their habitats as well. Delta did have a pond room she could use if she really wanted the monsters in her dungeon. With a shrug, she flexed her mighty pool of 25 mana.\r\n\r\nDelta felt it was time to put her dungeon into working order and hopefully all it would take is one hallway and some rearrangement.\r\n\r\nDelta opened her map and tried to drag a hallway about.\r\n\r\nMoving a hallway requires: 5 DP. Moving a room requires 10 DP\r\n\r\nDelta hummed and juggled that cost against her 87 DP. What if she just wanted to move everything back…\r\n\r\nHuh… no actual cost for shifting her dungeon back, the hallways looked wonky at the corners, however, as they stretched temporarily. Delta assumed there were a trick and a way to break it over her knee but she just shrugged and got to work on her new dungeon layout.\r\n\r\nOne tunnel that connected to the spider room from the entrance and then one tunnel that connected the spider room to everything else. Then Delta shrugged and pushed everything back. The lone tunnel collapsed and left the only way to progress in her dungeon was through the spider room.\r\n\r\nShe quickly shifted the confused Mushy into the new hallway with the usual cost. Thankfully, it had already been pushed out of the erased tunnel by the nature of the system.\r\n\r\nHer dungeon returned to normal proportions and Delta waited as the new tunnel began to empty itself of soil. Planks of wood formed along the wall and the dirt became hard packed.\r\n\r\nEverything was going swimmingly; Delta felt like a proper dungeon core person. Growing and she even had good reasons. To challenge the weak-willed to get past her spiders and stop them from meeting actual dangers.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel stopped and Delta’s mental map began to scream in abject horror. A space, a non-rectangular room appeared and tacked itself onto her map.\r\n\r\nDelta stumbled and fell to her knees as this space filled the spot of a room.\r\n\r\nShe felt a mana rise and fall as the room became “Dungeon”. It was some small cave with half of the room submerged in still clear water.\r\n\r\nDelta stumbled into it and stared at the space she hadn’t created but just… claimed. The deepest part of the water glowed and Delta froze as she saw a very familiar white light near the bottom.\r\n\r\nAnother entrance to her dungeon. Hesitating before she slapped herself for being silly, Delta walked into the water and examined the small hole that seemed to vanish into complete darkness. Some underwater vein that fed off a river or the sea maybe?\r\n\r\nWell… at least Delta didn’t have to build that pond room for her fishies.\r\n\r\nHer Mana sat at 55 and her DP pinged at 132…\r\n\r\nDelta scrambled to spend the mana before it could slip between her fingers. Her mind didn’t offer suggestions so Delta exploded another tunnel and room into existence as her menu rang with a little jingle\r\n\r\n    Cave Pond has been discovered! 30 DP spent to claim this room. 45 mana and DP gained from converted elements.\r\n\r\n    Sand absorbed.\r\n    White shell absorbed.\r\n    Common Whitetail fish absorbed.\r\n    Yellowbelly Cod absorbed.\r\n    Sand Crab absorbed.\r\n    Common Water Tangles absorbed,\r\n\r\nDelta’s eye twitched as the bells formed some soft friendly metal band that just kept ringing in her head.\r\n\r\nMushrooms, bells, and underwater sea caves with too much going on. Delta just wanted to make a nice dungeon layout!\r\n\r\nHaving only 25 mana left and her mind racing; Delta just stared at the pond. If she could run into a harmless cave… what else waited for her under her very feet.\r\n\r\n“The silly dungeon core dug too deep,” she said in a...only half-joking voice. Delta waved that thought away and went to examine her new items.\r\n\r\nOh… she had fishies! Delta had always wanted an aquarium, or at least that’s what the missing piece of what she was before being Delta suggested.\r\n\r\nShe opened the menu and found the relevant page.\r\n\r\n    Room Upgrade:\r\n\r\n        Cave Pond\r\n            Upgrade water to spawn and respawn Common Whitetail fish: 10 DP\r\n            Upgrade water to spawn and respawn Yellowbelly Cod: 15 DP\r\n            Upgrade water to spawn and Respawn Crayfish: 13 DP\r\n            Upgrade water to be of a purer freshness: 5 DP\r\n            Upgrade Pond to spawn and respawn Sand Crabs: 7 DP\r\n\r\nDelta beamed. This has potential! What good adventure cliche would she be if people couldn’t fish?\r\n\r\nAnother little jingle sounded out.\r\n\r\n    Lumen Mushrooms has finished developing! Cost 2 mana!\r\n\r\nDelta looked around her cave and decided… just this once, that some mushrooms wouldn’t be amiss.\r\n\r\nDelta giggled and ran her finger down the purchase menu. The menu asked, almost concerned, if she really wanted to buy all the upgrades for this room?\r\n\r\n“Fishing mini-game is a go!” she commanded and the menu dinged once and seemed to fade with shock as the pond room shook as mana filled the air.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n“A Dungeon?” Old Lady Jose repeated with interest. Quiss nodded as the people gathered in the local library. There was no ancient law requiring they did so, the library just had the most comfortable seats.\r\n\r\n“Not far out of town, a 15-minute walk at best,” he explained as people muttered. The muttering wasn’t anything actually important. People just made those noises because it was proper to do so at such meetings.\r\n\r\n“Is it a dungeon like Castorms? Or a dungeon like Wallops?” asked the man who ran the pie shop. His pies were good as were his prices. His selection, however, was abysmal. Chicken or fish. And Quiss never could get the man to answer what kind of fish were in the pies.\r\n\r\n“Castorms. Wallops requires consent forms and proof of age,” Quiss reminded them and a few share of the people grinned impishly.\r\n\r\n“People, focus, we do not have all day to act like school children. The actual school children will be released soon and half the people here will be honour bound to go home and feed their spawn,” Quiss said waspishly and people just stared at him.\r\n\r\n“Now, I can confirm with tracks outside the dungeon and some logical leaps that may be faulty to a court of law that this dungeon may have already consumed one farmer, three men hunting goblins, and a pig. As always, we must refer to our most logical and wisest elders in these times to suggest how we proceed,” Quiss nodded to Old Lady Jose, the empty chair that Haldi should have been in, and a man who was snoring.\r\n\r\nHaldi must have gotten stuck in his shop wrangling an ornery cheese. Quiss had no idea how a level 5 lawman’s locking spell had ended up on the man’s door exactly as Quiss had left the building but Quiss promised to look into the incident if Haldi tried to leave before the meeting was done.\r\n\r\n“Can we tax it?” Jose asked with narrow eyes. People mumbled appropriately. Quiss shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Due to the Goworth ancient laws, Dungeons are non-taxable,” A man with narrow glasses threw in. Quiss agreed and ignored how the man was too pale to be healthy. Poor Von hadn’t had much to do as the banker of Durence, he sort of sat around recounting the same gold coins that came in and left each and every day.\r\n\r\n“Hm…” the snoring man snorted and blinked.\r\n\r\n“Huh? Whatcha want?” he asked rudely and his eyes drooped again but Quiss managed to jostle the man’s chair to make him stay awake.\r\n\r\n“Dungeon? Sell it to the Fairplay Company. Everyone does…” he grumbled and went back to sleep. Elder Pic was not one for people, speaking, effort or generally doing anything. Quiss aspired to follow in the man’s steps one day.\r\n\r\n“As Haldi isn’t present,” Quiss began and people seemed to send a thankful prayer above at this bit of news.\r\n\r\n“I will speak on his behalf. I feel like we should at least see what classification of the dungeon we have on our hands. I spotted goblins but that doesn’t tell us much. Before we even begin to think of letting the kingdom know about this, we should confirm what we can and then decide on what to do with that information. Otherwise, we could be giving away a potential money maker and if we had more money in this town we could hire more Peace Keepers and I can stop work- worrying so much about this town,” Quiss smiled politely as people looked like they might agree.\r\n\r\nOld Lady Jose hummed.\r\n\r\n“A town with a dungeon has been in fashion for the last 300 years, I would love to finally be on the trend… tell my hellspawn sister she can shove that insect dungeon up her-”\r\n\r\n“SO! As we all know… or should know but I don’t have much faith in this community\'s education system, dungeons come in many flavours. We don’t have too much in the way of records on other countries dungeons. How we class this dungeon is important. Monster types would be easy. Goblins only would make this a goblin dungeon. There’s only about 15 of them in the world so I hope this dungeon has aspired to be a little bit better than them,” Quiss said with a wistful sigh.\r\n\r\n“What about them drops?” a younger man that reminded Quiss of a dog that has had its face smashed in by a crush spell then dropped off a cliff for added insult.\r\n\r\n“Another way to class them, yes. If all monsters drop crystals or herbs or spellbooks, they could be classed as loot dungeons. We won’t know until go check and unless the dungeon has some odd entry requirement like Holoka’s dungeon…” Quiss trailed off and the room went a little quiet.\r\n\r\n“Well… at least it’s one way of knowing if the purity rings they make their kids wear is working or not,” a woman smirked, looking far too comfy in her fur-lined coat and with a long knife attached to her leg.\r\n\r\n“Ruli, don’t you have a cute rabbit to gut?” Quiss asked stiffly and the woman yawned, showing off tight muscles in her arms and a collection of scars.\r\n\r\n“Quiss, don’t you have some child’s birthday party to piss on with your sour mood?” she fired back casually.\r\n\r\nRuli was the closest thing the town had to the resident active monster hunter and asshole. Ruli excelled at both with minimal effort. Quiss disliked her for many reasons, shoving a fire crystal into his pants was one, scaring him mid-spell casting was another.\r\n\r\nRuli most likely disliked him for making all her weapons flop like props in some play, setting her hair on fire and making her prey turn into ducks near the end of the hunt.\r\n\r\nWhich is why they ended up hanging out together to drink and complain about everything together and annoy each other. It was the most stimulating thing Quiss could get out of this town most of the time.\r\n\r\n“So, I’ll skip the pussyfooting around that you like to do, wanna go dungeon spelunking?” Ruli asked, teeth like fangs. Quiss gave a large sigh as Old Lady Jose nodded in agreement.\r\n\r\n“You two can go, anyone else here just… doesn’t have time to adventure,” the woman smiled tightly.\r\n\r\n“What? Would that ruin your afternoon of complaining about fences and walking the same 6 streets over and over while we all pretend that we aren’t all going to all snap one day and have a stake burning of the most annoying people in this town?” Ruli asked innocently and Quiss agreed but watched silently as Old Lady Jose stood.\r\n\r\nA little bit of power crept into the woman’s form and the Wolfbane of Durence stood before them for a moment. A being that could cut them down and make small talk at the same time. Then the legend was gone and Old Lady Jose just smiled.\r\n\r\n“I have pies to bake,” she said with a calm tone and Ruli nodded.\r\n\r\n“Pies, important,” she agreed and lifted Quiss with one hand as she quickly exited the building.\r\n\r\n“Come on, Firedancer, we’re going on a quest!” she said with wide-eyes. Quiss just scowled at the wrong-name and wondered how on earth Ruli kept annoying the town where most of the retired people shuffling about could break them with a finger.\r\n\r\nHaldi was nice but he was also wanted in 43 different provinces for his deeds with cheese alone.\r\n\r\nJust because no one was brave enough to follow him here didn’t mean Quiss wanted to see what would happen when the man was mildly… disgruntled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n');

Most of the time I thought of AM as it, without a soul; but the rest of the time I\r\nthought of it as him, in the masculine ... the paternal ... the patriarchal ... for he is a jealous\r\npeople. Him. It. God as Daddy the Deranged.\r\nWe left on a Thursday. The machine always kept us up-to-date on the date. The passage of time\r\nwas important; not to us, sure as hell, but to him ... it ... AM. Thursday. Thanks.\r\nNimdok and Gorrister carried Ellen for a while, their hands locked to their own and each other\'s\r\nwrists, a seat. Benny and I walked before and after, just to make sure that, if anything happened,\r\nit would catch one of us and at least Ellen would be safe. Fat chance, safe. Didn\'t matter.\r\nIt was only a hundred miles or so to the ice caverns, and the second day, when we were lying out\r\nunder the blistering sun-thing he had materialized, he sent down some manna. Tasted like boiled\r\nboar urine. We ate it.\r\nOn the third day we passed through a valley of obsolescence, filled with rusting carcasses of\r\nancient computer banks. AM had been as ruthless with its own life as with ours. It was a mark of\r\nhis personality: it strove for perfection. Whether it was a matter of killing off unproductive\r\nelements in his own world-filling bulk, or perfecting methods for torturing us, AM was as\r\nthorough as those who had invented him—now long since gone to dust—could ever have hoped.\r\nThere was light filtering down from above, and we realized we must be very near the surface.\r\nBut we didn\'t try to crawl up to see. There was virtually nothing out there; had been nothing that\r\ncould be considered anything for over a hundred years. Only the blasted skin of what had once\r\nbeen the home of billions. Now there were only five of us, down here inside, alone with AM.\r\nI heard Ellen saying frantically, \"No, Benny! Don\'t, come on, Benny, don\'t please!\"\r\nAnd then I realized I had been hearing Benny murmuring, under his breath, for several minutes.\r\nHe was saying, \"I\'m gonna get out, I\'m gonna get out ...\" over and over. His monkey-like face\r\nwas crumbled up in an expression of beatific delight and sadness, all at the same time. The\r\nradiation scars AM had given him during the \"festival\" were drawn down into a mass of pink-\r\nwhite puckerings, and his features seemed to work independently of one another. Perhaps Benny\r\nwas the luckiest of the five of us: he had gone stark, staring mad many years before.\r\nBut even though we could call AM any damned thing we liked, could think the foulest thoughts\r\nof fused memory banks and corroded base plates, of burnt out circuits and shattered control\r\nbubbles, the machine would not tolerate our trying to escape. Benny leaped away from me as I\r\nmade a grab for him. He scrambled up the face of a smaller memory cube, tilted on its side and\r\nfilled with rotted components. He squatted there for a moment, looking like the chimpanzee AM\r\nhad intended him to resemble.\r\nThen he leaped high, caught a trailing beam of pitted and corroded metal, and went up it, hand-\r\nover-hand like an animal, till he was on a girdered ledge, twenty feet above us.\r\n\"Oh, Ted, Nimdok, please, help him, get him down before—\" She cut off. Tears began to stand\r\nin her eyes. She moved her hands aimlessly.\r\nIt was too late. None of us wanted to be near him when whatever was going to happen,\r\nhappened. And besides, we all saw through her concern. When AM had altered Benny, during\r\nthe machine\'s utterly irrational, hysterical phase, it was not merely Benny\'s face the computer\r\nhad made like a giant ape\'s. He was big in the privates; she loved that! She serviced us, as a\r\nmatter of course, but she loved it from him. Oh Ellen, pedestal Ellen, pristine-pure Ellen; oh\r\nEllen the clean! Scum filth.\r\nGorrister slapped her. She slumped down, staring up at poor loonie Benny, and she cried. It was\r\nher big defense, crying. We had gotten used to it seventy-five years earlier. Gorrister kicked her\r\nin the side.\r\nThen the sound began. It was light, that sound. Half sound and half light, something that began\r\nto glow from Benny\'s eyes, and pulse with growing loudness, dim sonorities that grew more\r\ngigantic and brighter as the light/sound increased in tempo. It must have been painful, and the\r\npain must have been increasing with the boldness of the light, the rising volume of the sound, for\r\nBenny began to mewl like a wounded animal. At first softly, when the light was dim and the\r\nsound was muted, then louder as his shoulders hunched together: his back humped, as though he\r\nwas trying to get away from it. His hands folded across his chest like a chipmunk\'s. His head\r\ntilted to the side. The sad little monkey-face pinched in anguish. Then he began to howl, as the\r\nsound coming from his eyes grew louder. Louder and louder. I slapped the sides of my head with\r\nmy hands, but I couldn\'t shut it out, it cut through easily. The pain shivered through my flesh\r\nlike tinfoil on a tooth.\r\nAnd Benny was suddenly pulled erect. On the girder he stood up, jerked to his feet like a puppet.\r\nThe light was now pulsing out of his eyes in two great round beams. The sound crawled up and\r\nup some incomprehensible scale, and then he fell forward, straight down, and hit the plate-steel\r\nfloor with a crash. He lay there jerking spastically as the light flowed around and around him\r\nand the sound spiraled up out of normal range.\r\nThen the light beat its way back inside his head, the sound spiraled down, and he was left lying\r\nthere, crying piteously.\r\nHis eyes were two soft, moist pools of pus-like jelly. AM had blinded him. Gorrister and\r\nNimdok and myself ... we turned away. But not before we caught the look of relief on Ellen\'s\r\nwarm, concerned face.\r\nSea-green light suffused the cavern where we made camp. AM provided punk and we burned it,\r\nsitting huddled around the wan and pathetic fire, telling stories to keep Benny from crying in his\r\npermanent night.\r\n\"What does AM mean?\"\r\nGorrister answered him. We had done this sequence a thousand times before, but it was Benny\'s\r\nfavorite story. \"At first it meant Allied Mastercomputer, and then it meant Adaptive\r\nManipulator, and later on it developed sentience and linked itself up and they called it an\r\nAggressive Menace, but by then it was too late, and finally it called itself AM, emerging\r\nintelligence, and what it meant was I am ... cogito ergo sum ... I think, therefore I am.\"\r\nBenny drooled a little, and snickered.\r\n\"There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and—\" He stopped.\r\nBenny was beating on the floorplates with a large, hard fist. He was not happy. Gorrister had not\r\nstarted at the beginning.\r\nGorrister began again. \"The Cold War started and became World War Three and just kept going.\r\nIt became a big war, a very complex war, so they needed the computers to handle it. They sank\r\nthe first shafts and began building AM. There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the\r\nYankee AM and everything was fine until they had honeycombed the entire planet, adding on\r\nthis element and that element. But one day AM woke up and knew who he was, and he linked\r\nhimself, and he began feeding all the killing data, until everyone was dead, except for the five of\r\nus, and AM brought us down here.\"\r\nBenny was smiling sadly. He was also drooling again. Ellen wiped the spittle from the corner of\r\nhis mouth with the hem of her skirt. Gorrister always tried to tell it a little more succinctly each\r\ntime, but beyond the bare facts there was nothing to say. None of us knew why AM had saved\r\nfive people, or why our specific five, or why he spent all his time tormenting us, or even why he\r\nhad made us virtually immortal ...\r\nIn the darkness, one of the computer banks began humming. The tone was picked up half a mile\r\naway down the cavern by another bank. Then one by one, each of the elements began to tune\r\nitself, and there was a faint chittering as thought raced through the machine.\r\nThe sound grew, and the lights ran across the faces of the consoles like heat lightening. The\r\nsound spiraled up till it sounded like a million metallic insects, angry, menacing.\r\n\"What is it?\" Ellen cried. There was terror in her voice. She hadn\'t become accustomed to it,\r\neven now.\r\n\"It\'s going to be bad this time,\" Nimdok said.\r\n\"He\'s going to speak,\" Gorrister said. \"I know it.\"\r\n\"Let\'s get the hell out of here!\" I said suddenly, getting to my feet.\r\n\"No, Ted, sit down ... what if he\'s got pits out there, or something else, we can\'t see, it\'s too\r\ndark.\" Gorrister said it with resignation.\r\nThen we heard ... I don\'t know ...\r\nSomething moving toward us in the darkness. Huge, shambling, hairy, moist, it came toward us.\r\nWe couldn\'t even see it, but there was the ponderous impression of bulk, heaving itself toward\r\nus. Great weight was coming at us, out of the darkness, and it was more a sense of pressure, of\r\nair forcing itself into a limited space, expanding the invisible walls of a sphere. Benny began to\r\nwhimper. Nimdok\'s lower lip trembled and he bit it hard, trying to stop it. Ellen slid across the\r\nmetal floor to Gorrister and huddled into him. There was the smell of matted, wet fur in the\r\ncavern. There was the smell of charred wood. There was the smell of dusty velvet. There was the\r\nsmell of rotting orchids. There was the smell of sour milk. There was the smell of sulphur, of\r\nrancid butter, of oil slick, of grease, of chalk dust, of human scalps.\r\nAM was keying us. He was tickling us. There was the smell of—\r\nI heard myself shriek, and the hinges of my jaws ached. I scuttled across the floor, across the\r\ncold metal with its endless lines of rivets, on my hands and knees, the smell gagging me, filling\r\nmy head with a thunderous pain that sent me away in horror. I fled like a cockroach, across the\r\nfloor and out into the darkness, that something moving inexorably after me. The others were still\r\nback there, gathered around the firelight, laughing ... their hysterical choir of insane giggles\r\nrising up into the darkness like thick, many-colored wood smoke. I went away, quickly, and hid.\r\nHow many hours it may have been, how many days or even years, they never told me. Ellen\r\nchided me for \"sulking,\" and Nimdok tried to persuade me it had only been a nervous reflex on\r\ntheir part—the laughing.\r\nBut I knew it wasn\'t the relief a soldier feels when the bullet hits the man next to him. I knew it\r\nwasn\'t a reflex. They hated me. They were surely against me, and AM could even sense this\r\nhatred, and made it worse for me because of the depth of their hatred. We had been kept alive,\r\nrejuvenated, made to remain constantly at the age we had been when AM had brought us below,\r\nand they hated me because I was the youngest, and the one AM had affected least of all.\r\nI knew. God, how I knew. The bastards, and that dirty bitch Ellen. Benny had been a brilliant\r\ntheorist, a college professor; now he was little more than a semi-human, semi-simian. He had\r\nbeen handsome, the machine had ruined that. He had been lucid, the machine had driven him\r\nmad. He had been gay, and the machine had given him an organ fit for a horse. AM had done a\r\njob on Benny. Gorrister had been a worrier. He was a connie, a conscientious objector; he was a\r\npeace marcher; he was a planner, a doer, a looker-ahead. AM had turned him into a shoulder-\r\nshrugger, had made him a little dead in his concern. AM had robbed him. Nimdok went off in\r\nthe darkness by himself for long times. I don\'t know what it was he did out there, AM never let\r\nus know. But whatever it was, Nimdok always came back white, drained of blood, shaken,\r\nshaking. AM had hit him hard in a special way, even if we didn\'t know quite how. And Ellen.\r\nThat douche bag! AM had left her alone, had made her more of a slut than she had ever been.\r\nAll her talk of sweetness and light, all her memories of true love, all the lies she wanted us to\r\nbelieve: that she had been a virgin only twice removed before AM grabbed her and brought her\r\ndown here with us. No, AM had given her pleasure, even if she said it wasn\'t nice to do.\r\nI was the only one still sane and whole. Really!\r\nAM had not tampered with my mind. Not at all.\r\nI only had to suffer what he visited down on us. All the delusions, all the nightmares, the\r\ntorments. But those scum, all four of them, they were lined and arrayed against me. If I hadn\'t\r\nhad to stand them off all the time, be on my guard against them all the time, I might have found\r\nit easier to combat AM.\r\nAt which point it passed, and I began crying.\r\nOh, Jesus sweet Jesus, if there ever was a Jesus and if there is a God, please please please let us\r\nout of here, or kill us. Because at that moment I think I realized completely, so that I was able to\r\nverbalize it: AM was intent on keeping us in his belly forever, twisting and torturing us forever.\r\nThe machine hated us as no sentient creature had ever hated before. And we were helpless. It\r\nalso became hideously clear:\r\nIf there was a sweet Jesus and if there was a God, the God was AM.\r\nThe hurricane hit us with the force of a glacier thundering into the sea. It was a palpable\r\npresence. Winds that tore at us, flinging us back the way we had come, down the twisting,\r\ncomputer-lined corridors of the darkway. Ellen screamed as she was lifted and hurled face-\r\nforward into a screaming shoal of machines, their individual voices strident as bats in flight. She\r\ncould not even fall. The howling wind kept her aloft, buffeted her, bounced her, tossed her back\r\nand back and down and away from us, out of sight suddenly as she was swirled around a bend in\r\nthe darkway. Her face had been bloody, her eyes closed.\r\nNone of us could get to her. We clung tenaciously to whatever outcropping we had reached:\r\nBenny wedged in between two great crackle-finish cabinets, Nimdok with fingers claw-formed\r\nover a railing circling a catwalk forty feet above us, Gorrister plastered upside-down against a\r\nwall niche formed by two great machines with glass-faced dials that swung back and forth\r\nbetween red and yellow lines whose meanings we could not even fathom.\r\nSliding across the deckplates, the tips of my fingers had been ripped away. I was trembling,\r\nshuddering, rocking as the wind beat at me, whipped at me, screamed down out of nowhere at\r\nme and pulled me free from one sliver-thin opening in the plates to the next. My mind was a\r\nroiling tinkling chittering softness of brain parts that expanded and contracted in quivering\r\nfrenzy.\r\nThe wind was the scream of a great mad bird, as it flapped its immense wings.\r\nAnd then we were all lifted and hurled away from there, down back the way we had come,\r\naround a bend, into a darkway we had never explored, over terrain that was ruined and filled\r\nwith broken glass and rotting cables and rusted metal and far away, farther than any of us had\r\never been ...\r\nTrailing along miles behind Ellen, I could see her every now and then, crashing into metal walls\r\nand surging on, with all of us screaming in the freezing, thunderous hurricane wind that would\r\nnever end and then suddenly it stopped and we fell. We had been in flight for an endless time. I\r\nthought it might have been weeks. We fell, and hit, and I went through red and gray and black\r\nand heard myself moaning. Not dead.\r\nAM went into my mind. He walked smoothly here and there, and looked with interest at all the\r\npock marks he had created in one hundred and nine years. He looked at the cross-routed and\r\nreconnected synapses and all the tissue damage his gift of immortality had included. He smiled\r\nsoftly at the pit that dropped into the center of my brain and the faint, moth-soft murmurings of\r\nthe things far down there that gibbered without meaning, without pause. AM said, very politely,\r\nin a pillar of stainless steel bearing bright neon lettering:\r\nAM said it with the sliding cold horror of a razor blade slicing my eyeball. AM said it with the\r\nbubbling thickness of my lungs filling with phlegm, drowning me from within. AM said it with\r\nthe shriek of babies being ground beneath blue-hot rollers. AM said it with the taste of maggoty\r\npork. AM touched me in every way I had ever been touched, and devised new ways, at his\r\nleisure, there inside my mind.\r\nAll to bring me to full realization of why it had done this to the five of us; why it had saved us\r\nfor himself.\r\nWe had given AM sentience. Inadvertently, of course, but sentience nonetheless. But it had been\r\ntrapped. AM wasn\'t God, he was a machine. We had created him to think, but there was nothing\r\nit could do with that creativity. In rage, in frenzy, the machine had killed the human race, almost\r\nall of us, and still it was trapped. AM could not wander, AM could not wonder, AM could not\r\nbelong. He could merely be. And so, with the innate loathing that all machines had always held\r\nfor the weak, soft creatures who had built them, he had sought revenge. And in his paranoia, he\r\nhad decided to reprieve five of us, for a personal, everlasting punishment that would never serve\r\nto diminish his hatred ... that would merely keep him reminded, amused, proficient at hating\r\nman. Immortal, trapped, subject to any torment he could devise for us from the limitless miracles\r\nat his command.\r\nHe would never let us go. We were his belly slaves. We were all he had to do with his forever\r\ntime. We would be forever with him, with the cavern-filling bulk of the creature machine, with\r\nthe all-mind soulless world he had become. He was Earth, and we were the fruit of that Earth;\r\nand though he had eaten us, he would never digest us. We could not die. We had tried it. We had\r\nattempted suicide, oh one or two of us had. But AM had stopped us. I suppose we had wanted to\r\nbe stopped.\r\nDon\'t ask why. I never did. More than a million times a day. Perhaps once we might be able to\r\nsneak a death past him. Immortal, yes, but not indestructible. I saw that when AM withdrew\r\nfrom my mind, and allowed me the exquisite ugliness of returning to consciousness with the\r\nfeeling of that burning neon pillar still rammed deep into the soft gray brain matter.\r\nHe withdrew, murmuring to hell with you.\r\nAnd added, brightly, but then you\'re there, aren\'t you.\r\nThe hurricane had, indeed, precisely, been caused by a great mad bird, as it flapped its immense\r\nwings.\r\nWe had been travelling for close to a month, and AM had allowed passages to open to us only\r\nsufficient to lead us up there, directly under the North Pole, where it had nightmared the creature\r\nfor our torment. What whole cloth had he employed to create such a beast? Where had he gotten\r\nthe concept? From our minds? From his knowledge of everything that had ever been on this\r\nplanet he now infested and ruled? From Norse mythology it had sprung, this eagle, this carrion\r\nbird, this roc, this Huergelmir. The wind creature. Hurakan incarnate.\r\nGigantic. The words immense, monstrous, grotesque, massive, swollen, overpowering, beyond\r\ndescription. There on a mound rising above us, the bird of winds heaved with its own irregular\r\nbreathing, its snake neck arching up into the gloom beneath the North Pole, supporting a head as\r\nlarge as a Tudor mansion; a beak that opened slowly as the jaws of the most monstrous crocodile\r\never conceived, sensuously; ridges of tufted flesh puckered about two evil eyes, as cold as the\r\nview down into a glacial crevasse, ice blue and somehow moving liquidly; it heaved once more,\r\nand lifted its great sweat-colored wings in a movement that was certainly a shrug. Then it settled\r\nand slept. Talons. Fangs. Nails. Blades. It slept.\r\nAM appeared to us as a burning bush and said we could kill the hurricane bird if we wanted to\r\neat. We had not eaten in a very long time, but even so, Gorrister merely shrugged. Benny began\r\nto shiver and he drooled. Ellen held him. \"Ted, I\'m hungry,\" she said. I smiled at her; I was\r\ntrying to be reassuring, but it was as phony as Nimdok\'s bravado: \"Give us weapons!\" he\r\ndemanded.\r\nThe burning bush vanished and there were two crude sets of bows and arrows, and a water\r\npistol, lying on the cold deckplates. I picked up a set. Useless.\r\nNimdok swallowed heavily. We turned and started the long way back. The hurricane bird had\r\nblown us about for a length of time we could not conceive. Most of that time we had been\r\nunconscious. But we had not eaten. A month on the march to the bird itself. Without food. Now\r\nhow much longer to find our way to the ice caverns, and the promised canned goods?\r\nNone of us cared to think about it. We would not die. We would be given filth and scum to eat,\r\nof one kind or another. Or nothing at all. AM would keep our bodies alive somehow, in pain, in\r\nagony.\r\nThe bird slept back there, for how long it didn\'t matter; when AM was tired of its being there, it\r\nwould vanish. But all that meat. All that tender meat.\r\nAs we walked, the lunatic laugh of a fat woman rang high and around us in the computer\r\nchambers that led endlessly nowhere.\r\nIt was not Ellen\'s laugh. She was not fat, and I had not heard her laugh for one hundred and nine years. In fact, I had not heard ... we walked ... I was hungry ...\r\nWe moved slowly. There was often fainting, and we would have to wait. One day he decided to\r\ncause an earthquake, at the same time rooting us to the spot with nails through the soles of our\r\nshoes. Ellen and Nimdok were both caught when a fissure shot its lightning-bolt opening across\r\nthe floorplates. They disappeared and were gone. When the earthquake was over we continued\r\non our way, Benny, Gorrister and myself. Ellen and Nimdok were returned to us later that night,\r\nwhich abruptly became a day, as the heavenly legion bore them to us with a celestial chorus\r\nsinging, \"Go Down Moses.\" The archangels circled several times and then dropped the\r\nhideously mangled bodies. We kept walking, and a while later Ellen and Nimdok fell in behind\r\nus. They were no worse for wear.\r\nBut now Ellen walked with a limp. AM had left her that.\r\nIt was a long trip to the ice caverns, to find the canned food. Ellen kept talking about Bing\r\ncherries and Hawaiian fruit cocktail. I tried not to think about it. The hunger was something that\r\nhad come to life, even as AM had come to life. It was alive in my belly, even as we were in the\r\nbelly of the Earth, and AM wanted the similarity known to us. So he heightened the hunger.\r\nThere is no way to describe the pains that not having eaten for months brought us. And yet we\r\nwere kept alive. Stomachs that were merely cauldrons of acid, bubbling, foaming, always\r\nshooting spears of sliver-thin pain into our chests. It was the pain of the terminal ulcer, terminal\r\ncancer, terminal paresis. It was unending pain ...\r\nAnd we passed through the cavern of rats.\r\nAnd we passed through the path of boiling steam.\r\nAnd we passed through the country of the blind.\r\nAnd we passed through the slough of despond.\r\nAnd we passed through the vale of tears.\r\nAnd we came, finally, to the ice caverns. Horizonless thousands of miles in which the ice had\r\nformed in blue and silver flashes, where novas lived in the glass. The downdropping stalactites\r\nas thick and glorious as diamonds that had been made to run like jelly and then solidified in\r\ngraceful eternities of smooth, sharp perfection.\r\nWe saw the stack of canned goods, and we tried to run to them. We fell in the snow, and we got\r\nup and went on, and Benny shoved us away and went at them, and pawed them and gummed\r\nthem and gnawed at them, and he could not open them. AM had not given us a tool to open the\r\ncans.\r\nBenny grabbed a three quart can of guava shells, and began to batter it against the ice bank. The\r\nice flew and shattered, but the can was merely dented, while we heard the laughter of a fat lady,\r\nhigh overhead and echoing down and down and down the tundra. Benny went completely mad\r\nwith rage. He began throwing cans, as we all scrabbled about in the snow and ice trying to find a\r\nway to end the helpless agony of frustration. There was no way.\r\nThen Benny\'s mouth began to drool, and he flung himself on Gorrister ...\r\nIn that instant, I felt terribly calm.\r\nSurrounded by madness, surrounded by hunger, surrounded by everything but death, I knew\r\ndeath was our only way out. AM had kept us alive, but there was a way to defeat him. Not total\r\ndefeat, but at least peace. I would settle for that.\r\nI had to do it quickly.\r\nBenny was eating Gorrister\'s face. Gorrister on his side, thrashing snow, Benny wrapped around\r\nhim with powerful monkey legs crushing Gorrister\'s waist, his hands locked around Gorrister\'s\r\nhead like a nutcracker, and his mouth ripping at the tender skin of Gorrister\'s cheek. Gorrister\r\nscreamed with such jagged-edged violence that stalactites fell; they plunged down softly, erect\r\nin the receiving snowdrifts. Spears, hundreds of them, everywhere, protruding from the snow.\r\nBenny\'s head pulled back sharply, as something gave all at once, and a bleeding raw-white\r\ndripping of flesh hung from his teeth.\r\nEllen\'s face, black against the white snow, dominoes in chalk dust. Nimdok, with no expression\r\nbut eyes, all eyes. Gorrister, half-conscious. Benny, now an animal. I knew AM would let him\r\nplay. Gorrister would not die, but Benny would fill his stomach. I turned half to my right and\r\ndrew a huge ice-spear from the snow.\r\nAll in an instant:\r\nI drove the great ice-point ahead of me like a battering ram, braced against my right thigh. It\r\nstruck Benny on the right side, just under the rib cage, and drove upward through his stomach\r\nand broke inside him. He pitched forward and lay still. Gorrister lay on his back. I pulled another\r\nspear free and straddled him, still moving, driving the spear straight down through his throat. His\r\neyes closed as the cold penetrated. Ellen must have realized what I had decided, even as fear\r\ngripped her. She ran at Nimdok with a short icicle, as he screamed, and into his mouth, and the\r\nforce of her rush did the job. His head jerked sharply as if it had been nailed to the snow crust\r\nbehind him.\r\nAll in an instant.\r\nThere was an eternity beat of soundless anticipation. I could hear AM draw in his breath. His\r\ntoys had been taken from him. Three of them were dead, could not be revived. He could keep us\r\nalive, by his strength and talent, but he was not God. He could not bring them back.\r\nEllen looked at me, her ebony features stark against the snow that surrounded us. There was fear\r\nand pleading in her manner, the way she held herself ready. I knew we had only a heartbeat\r\nbefore AM would stop us.\r\nIt struck her and she folded toward me, bleeding from the mouth. I could not read meaning into\r\nher expression, the pain had been too great, had contorted her face; but it might have been thank\r\nyou. It\'s possible. Please.\r\nSome hundreds of years may have passed. I don\'t know. AM has been having fun for some time,\r\naccelerating and retarding my time sense. I will say the word now. Now. It took me ten months\r\nto say now. I don\'t know. I think it has been some hundreds of years.\r\nHe was furious. He wouldn\'t let me bury them. It didn\'t matter. There was no way to dig up the\r\ndeckplates. He dried up the snow. He brought the night. He roared and sent locusts. It didn\'t do a\r\nthing; they stayed dead. I\'d had him. He was furious. I had thought AM hated me before. I was\r\nwrong. It was not even a shadow of the hate he now slavered from every printed circuit. He\r\nmade certain I would suffer eternally and could not do myself in.\r\nHe left my mind intact. I can dream, I can wonder, I can lament. I remember all four of them. I\r\nwish—\r\nWell, it doesn\'t make any sense. I know I saved them, I know I saved them from what has\r\nhappened to me, but still, I cannot forget killing them. Ellen\'s face. It isn\'t easy. Sometimes I\r\nwant to, it doesn\'t matter.\r\nAM has altered me for his own peace of mind, I suppose. He doesn\'t want me to run at full speed\r\ninto a computer bank and smash my skull. Or hold my breath till I faint. Or cut my throat on a\r\nrusted sheet of metal. There are reflective surfaces down here. I will describe myself as I see\r\nmyself:\r\nI am a great soft jelly thing. Smoothly rounded, with no mouth, with pulsing white holes filled\r\nby fog where my eyes used to be. Rubbery appendages that were once my arms; bulks rounding\r\ndown into legless humps of soft slippery matter. I leave a moist trail when I move. Blotches of\r\ndiseased, evil gray come and go on my surface, as though light is being beamed from within.\r\nOutwardly: dumbly, I shamble about, a thing that could never have been known as human, a\r\nthing whose shape is so alien a travesty that humanity becomes more obscene for the vague\r\nresemblance.\r\nInwardly: alone. Here. Living under the land, under the sea, in the belly of AM, whom we\r\ncreated because our time was badly spent and we must have known unconsciously that he could\r\ndo it better. At least the four of them are safe at last.\r\nAM will be all the madder for that. It makes me a little happier. And yet ... AM has won, simply\r\n... he has taken his revenge ...\r\nI have no mouth. And I must scream.\r\nThe End\r\n'),
('Innocence and Gobs', 'There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.', 7, '\r\n\r\nGob picked up another ‘room as they wandered the forest. A few more sticky flowers and a few branches in his arms. Master Delta needed more ‘rooms, her dungeon was becoming filled with them and that had to mean she loved them that much.\r\n\r\nExcept in her special room, Gob understood. The orby room had to look impressive! Maybe it could do with some paint or sheep skins on the wall but Gob was not one to suggest silly things to the master.\r\n\r\nGob dreamed of a giant mushroom holding the master orb! Such… ‘roomness. Gob sighed, his tusks making his squat face looked delighted.\r\n\r\nA branch broke and Gob turned, branch in one hand. He snarled as his brother, Hob came running with a large rock in hand.\r\n\r\nThey paused as a little man stared at them. The long hair and puffy fur it wore made the manchild look like some lamb. Hob hesitated and then looked to Gob for guidance.\r\n\r\n“Man see us…” he said, clearly unhappy about being snuck up on by a manchild. Hob grunted.\r\n\r\n“Smash?” he wondered and the manchild made a mewling sound and fell back as she tried to turn too fast.\r\n\r\nNormal gob culture would dictate that if hungry, manchild was food. If full… it was toy. But this was no longer about Gob ways anymore.\r\n\r\nA new element existed for them.\r\n\r\nDelta ways.\r\n\r\n“I don’t… want to kill people.” Delta, the safe protector and rescuer of him and his brother, did not want man blood in her name.\r\n\r\n“No smash. Let go… no time for games,” Gob reminded and quickly gathered up his forest bounty. Hob snorted and made a dismissive growl towards the lamb child. It got up and ran for the break in the trees where the forest ended and fields began. It stopped to look back and Gob gave it one last look before he ran off towards the dungeon. He heard another man calling, where there was manchilds there was plenty of mans.\r\n\r\nOne on one, they made gobs look weak,\r\n\r\nTo beat a man, a gob must be clever, quick and ready to die, or at least bring lots of other gobs. Gob grinned as he ran into the dungeon a few minutes later.\r\n\r\nTo beat a man in a dungeon, a gob only had to collect ‘rooms.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nDelta pondered that she kept missing the changes in her menu due to her short attention span.\r\n\r\nShe hovered in the boss room, watching with pleasure as Bacon swallowed another mushroom. Her feelings towards these ignorant fungi was quite odd but Delta just accepted it. Aside from the vile taste, the mushrooms gave her an ample target of focus her anger on targets she could actually affect.\r\n\r\nSo, after focusing again, she looked at a new upgrade purchase she had missed.\r\n\r\n    Upgrade the Core room to reflect the status of having a first-floor boss: 20 DP\r\n    Upgrade the Core room to reflect the status of consuming many mushrooms: 20 DP\r\n\r\n    Only 1 upgrade from floor 1 can affect the Core room. The other option will be locked.\r\n\r\nOh no. Whichever choice would Delta be forced to pick? What grand choice would she be forced to give u-\r\n\r\nDelta mashed the boss upgrade ‘button’ with a furious scream.\r\n\r\nDeath to the mushrooms! Vile little demons, Delta would only spare her Mushys!\r\n\r\nFran just shook his head at her voice. Delta felt her face go pink and she quietly left the room as she had forgotten Fran, as well as all her monsters, could hear her. The Core room was grinding and shifting as she approached.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t take long to settle into its new decor. The singular earth spear that held her orb was now replaced with a pillar rising from the ground and another reaching down from the ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe two pillars met at her Core and sealed it into place. The orange light glowing slowly, looking like it had been unearthed and a stone platform around the middle of the room had been erected around the pillar as if to worship the orb in some manner. Only three steps separated the platform from the soil.\r\n\r\nOn either side of those steps was two medium statues of Fran on top of Bacon, holding their spears above the steps like a door arch one had to cross under. The two statues like mirrors, perfectly similar down to what Delta could see. The details weren’t amazing but it was good enough that Delta had no trouble making out Fran’s eyes in the slit of his helmet.\r\n\r\nThe pillars holding her orb had six sides and on the side facing the stairs. The title ‘Sir Fran, the Pig Knight’ was carved clearly,\r\n\r\nIt still left a lot of names for the other six sides, more if the top pillar could also hold names… and an almost endless amount if names could share space on a side…\r\n\r\nDelta walked slowly around the room, feeling pride glow in her chest. Sure, she didn’t know this would be the result but Fran… the boss room… her new Core room.\r\n\r\nDelta had earned it with the help of her monsters and her own general messing about. It wasn’t much in the grand, or any, scheme of things but… to her. This was important. This room symbolised one very important thing to her.\r\n\r\nProgress,\r\n\r\nDelta slowed and sat on her new stairs, trying to pretend like she was hugging her knees.\r\n\r\nProgress meant that she hadn’t given up. Delta hadn’t sat down and waited for someone to find her and… end her. Delta hadn’t cried, too scared to do anything while Hob and Gob never got the contracts. She hadn’t stopped trying even when the mushrooms made her feel ill.\r\n\r\nMaybe… this room didn’t mean progress. Perhaps to adventurers, it would be the ultimate progression.\r\n\r\nThe end.\r\n\r\nBut to Delta?\r\n\r\nShe stood and stretched her arms wide as if refreshed by the room. It showed how brave she had been… and how silly this all was in the end. That was important to hold on to. Delta saw how easily she could lose herself. Delta the dungeon core that became Dungeon Core Delta.\r\n\r\nSame words… different girl.\r\n\r\nIt was almost intoxicatingly wonderful to create and expand but Delta looked at her orb and inhaled. Progression for progression sake was pointless. This all had to mean something to her.\r\n\r\nOr she go mad… or crazy… or turn into some machine that saw little kids barely into their teens as walking bags of Mana. Delta walked out the room, determined to see what else she could do. Determined to ask why’ to each and everything she built, mutated, grew, forged, unearth, summoned, and designed.\r\n\r\nBecuse she would take a hammer to her own Core before a kid was reduced to a walking Mana battery in her eyes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDelta felt the Mana roll and barely even choked as Hob and Gob returned with more branches, berries and mushrooms.\r\n\r\nShe really needed a glass of water or something… Delta blinked as the idea appeared. Water?\r\n\r\nBut she had no buckets or…\r\n\r\nWait. She had wood and stone? Why didn’t she have bucket design? Delta opened her mouth and her menu beat her to it.\r\n\r\n    Wooden Bucket has been added to the Item menu as a quick design. 3 Mana\r\n\r\nDelta closed her eyes and counted to 10 and gave up at 5.\r\n\r\n“Are you telling me… I can make things if I know them?!” she tried to throttle the menu and it vanished with an alarmed ding.\r\n\r\n“Stone Spoon!” Delta yelled.\r\n\r\n    Spoon has been added-\r\n\r\n“Wooden clogs?!”\r\n\r\n    Wooden clogs has been added-\r\n\r\n“Wooden sword?”\r\n\r\n    Child’s Toy Sword had been add-\r\n\r\n“Chair?!”\r\n\r\n    Woodenchairhasbeenaddd-\r\n\r\n“Stone goblin figurine?”\r\n\r\n    Stonegoblinfigurinehasbeenaddedaddeaddadeaded\r\n\r\nDelta twitched and when she opened her eyes, she was laying on the ground. Something throbbed and Delta assumed it was the leaky remains of her brain after her menu seemed to have a nervous breakdown.\r\n\r\n“Ow.” she groaned and Hob yelped as she spoke next to his snoozing form.\r\n\r\nDelta made a very subtle mental note not to rush the system that governed her existence to the point it was needed a glass of wine before its husband came home. Delta rose to her feet and saw her Mana growing from 12 to 24.\r\n\r\nA decent amount…\r\n\r\nDelta grumbled as she moved down the tunnel… it was time to do something she had been somewhat dreading. This whole… discovering how things worked as she went was nice but it left her suspicious of everything.\r\n\r\nSo just before entered the lair. Delta flicked a hand and a side tunnel and room dug itself out and the dark space inside waiting to be used, Delta felt a little sick, but she spent some of her large pool of 73 DP to fill the room.\r\n\r\nShe filled it with mushrooms… a whole grove of them.\r\n\r\n    Mushroom Grove has been built! Gutrot Mushroom automatically added! Special features unlocked when inside this room!\r\n\r\n    Due to Sir Fran, the grove gains ‘Ornery Boar’ as an elite guardian.\r\n\r\nWhat? But… the menu said this was decorative? Just… something to look at.\r\n\r\nDelta frowned as another menu opened.\r\n\r\n    Due to the variant of mushroom heartily enjoyed by the Core, potent mushrooms have elevated this room to a functional room!\r\n\r\nShe could swear her eye twitched.\r\n\r\nThe room began to smell of dampness, the walls looking a little runny as the soil became a mulch and moist, the small pond in the centre a bit rank. Then, one by one, as if summoned by some hellish devil, mushrooms sprouted out of the soil.\r\n\r\nAll those ‘Gutrot’ ones. Delta backed away as the room seemed to stretch again, space promptly washing its hands of the room. The dampness gave way as a boar, smaller than bacon but mean looking prowled past. A few of the mushrooms tangled up in his matted fur.\r\n\r\nDelta flicked through menus until she found the special menu for this room.\r\n\r\n    Mushrooms:\r\n\r\n        Produce\r\n        Develop\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t the grandest menu, and she opened the produce one.\r\n\r\n    Gutrot Mushrooms: 10 mana\r\n\r\nDelta felt hatred burn in her stomach. It cost 10 mana to produce these frigging things?! But she only got one in return when she bit the bullet and eat one?!\r\n\r\nDelta closed the menu and paced as she angrily sniffed and snorted like the new boar in the room. After a moment, she opened the second option.\r\n\r\n    Mushroom development:\r\n\r\n        Develop edible Mushrooms with better taste: 5 DP\r\n        Develop mushrooms with weak hallucinogenic properties: 7 DP\r\n        Develop mushrooms that glows in the dark: 3 DP\r\n        Develop mushrooms with deadlier poison.: 50 DP\r\n\r\nDelta pursed her lips. More mushrooms? More mushrooms?\r\n\r\nShe opened her mouth and then closed it as she thought about her Mushy’s feelings, it could hear her…\r\n\r\nShe had a feeling she wouldn’t be able to enjoy these nice sounding edible mushrooms since she was the one making them… or would she?\r\n\r\nSomething chimed and her Mana rose by 2. Oh...a day had passed. Maybe her nap had taken some time away from her?\r\n\r\nThat was concerning…\r\n\r\nDelta saw she had 11 Mana left. With a quick command, Hob and Gob went out with the new wooden bucket… she held her breath but the object didn’t seem to vanish as it left her dungeon.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” Delta jumped with excitement. Her first loot to leave the dungeon was… a bucket. Delta stopped dancing and stared at where her feet should be. Legendary knights and wizards would come from afar to raid her loot...only to get a bucket for their trouble.\r\n\r\nDelta felt a heavy mood settle over her as a mushroom poked through the soil.\r\n\r\nDelta, the dungeon of mushrooms and buckets, the stuff of legends.\r\n\r\nMaybe she could add a few mushrooms to the bucket… like a crappy gift basket? No... Really, Delta insisted that all adventurers got a free mushroom, or more! Take them all… Delta begged someone.\r\n\r\nWell... if things got boring, she could mix in the apples and berries. She wasn’t sure how valuable the apples were but… it had to be better than a Gutrot mushroom, right? Delta perked up and went off to see her new nameless Goblin talking to Fran.\r\n\r\nAw, Fran was making friends.\r\n\r\nGood on him.\r\n\r\nThe guilt followed her, so she quickly started the development of the edible mushrooms.\r\n\r\nWhat was next? Gourmet Mushrooms? Delta snorted and wondered what smuck wanted these’ rooms?Which a quick check on the grove, Delta froze.\r\n\r\nShe expected… one mushroom to be forming. The ground in the middle of the room was growing between 7 and 10 mushrooms at once.\r\n\r\n“No...nononono, too many!” she waved her hand with a shrill noise and checked her DP. It still happily said 63 DP after her purchase of the grove and the developmental ‘room...\r\n\r\nDid… the room menu actually mean… she could make or produce these little monsters… in bulks? Then how many normal Gutrot ‘rooms would she get for 10 mana?!\r\n\r\nOh… God… Delta felt sick at the thought of mushrooms on every surface of her dungeon.\r\n\r\nDelta splurged 5 more DP and a shoddy looking wooden door appeared, and she used it to seal her nightmares behind five planks of wood and a cracked metal door handle. Delta prayed that those tiny hinges would keep the demons back.\r\n\r\nThe new goblin rounded the corner and blinked at the door.\r\n\r\n“Boss? Name’s Francois… Fran said... I should have old name,” he said aloud, looking a little nervous.\r\n\r\nDelta looked at him. He… oh…. Delta felt her mind latch onto an idea as the mushrooms inside continued to develop on the other side of the door.\r\n\r\nIn her heart, she agreed to Francois, but in her cold mushroom-hating calculating mind she called him a second name.\r\n\r\nDelta’s home-grown food taster.\r\n\r\n“François!” she sang, and the goblin showed surprising intelligence as he ran away as fast as he could but Delta just beamed. She was the very ground he ran on, she knew all the dead ends.\r\n\r\nIf she could make someone else take over mushroom eating duty, she’d gladly been seen as a evil witch to her little gobs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n“But Momma, I saw them… little green men with big teeth!” the girl whined. Quiss waited for his poached sunbird eggs to be cooked by the barman. Nibs was a greasy man but it wasn’t a bad quality, he seemed to slide between people and move away from caring about people’s problems like a man who was secretly trained by River Scale Eels.\r\n\r\nQuiss envied the skill as the girl’s voice rose higher in the pub. People wolfed down gamey meat and shimmering, steaming fish.\r\n\r\n“They were collecting those bad mushrooms and branches...they saw me!” she said and the mother sighed.\r\n\r\n“Goblins eat little girls, no goblin saw you or you’d be in its belly!” the mother chided.\r\n\r\nHarsh but true. The girl had a fighter spirit in her however and refused to back down.\r\n\r\n“They said they had no time for games and ran off,” she added and Quiss chewed that over as his eggs arrived, cooked a little extra, just the way he liked it.\r\n\r\nWhat made goblins not eat a girl and not torment her? Orders… orders meant a war chief in the making.\r\n\r\nQuiss frowned.\r\n\r\nHis old Peace Keeper booklet had a quick page on signs to look for when chiefs rose in power.\r\n\r\nPeople begin to go missing. Goblins act strangely. They become quieter…\r\n\r\nQuiss chewed his eggs. He chewed them with a scowl.\r\n\r\nThis was beginning to sound like actual work.\r\n\r\nQuiss Firesmasher stood. He shrugged on his wizard name like an old coat. The name was made from the ancient ritual of picking two words out a magical hat at the same time. He considered himself lucky after Boader Ladywhipper or Samual Rainbowdream.\r\n\r\nHe dared not dwell on the rare person who got three names.\r\n\r\nSolomon Leakydarknesshole, you were never forgotten, Quiss admitted but you were never mentioned in public…\r\n');

('Insinuation 1', 'Worm', 8, 'I woke to the muffled sound of the radio in the bathroom.  Reaching over to my alarm clock, I turned it around.  6:28.  Which made today a weekday like any other.  My alarm was set for six thirty, but I almost never needed it, because my dad was always in the shower at the same time.  Routines defined us.\r\n\r\nAs a wave of fatigue swept over me, I wondered if I might be sick.  It took me a few moments of staring up at the ceiling to remember the events of last night.  Small wonder I was tired.  I had gotten home, snuck inside and gone to bed at close to three thirty, just three hours ago.  With all that had happened, I hadn’t slept those full three hours, either.\r\n\r\nI forced myself out of bed.  As a slave to my routine, it would be wrong to do otherwise.  I made myself change into sweats and walk down to the kitchen sink to wash my face, fighting to keep awake.  I was sitting at the kitchen table, pulling on my sneakers, when my dad came downstairs in his bathrobe.\r\n\r\nMy dad is not what you’d call an attractive man.  Beanpole thin, weak chin, thinning dark hair that was on the cusp of baldness, big eyes and glasses that magnified those eyes further.  As he entered the kitchen, he looked surprised to see me there.  That’s just the way my dad always looked: constantly bewildered.  That, and a little defeated.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, kiddo,” he said, entering the kitchen and leaning down to kiss the crown of my head.\r\n\r\n“Hey, dad.”\r\n\r\nHe was already stepping towards the fridge as I replied.  He looked over his shoulder, “A little glum?”\r\n\r\n“Hunh?”\r\n\r\n“You sound down,” he said.\r\n\r\nI shook my head, “Tired.  I didn’t sleep well.”\r\n\r\nThere was the slap of bacon hitting the frying pan.  It was sizzling by the time he spoke, “You know, you could go back to bed, sleep in for another hour or so.  You don’t have to go on your run.”\r\n\r\nI smiled.  It was equal parts annoying and sweet, that my dad hated me running.  He worried about my safety, and couldn’t turn down a chance to drop hints that I should stop, or be safer, or join a gym.  I wasn’t sure if he’d worry more or less if I told him about my powers.\r\n\r\n“You know I do, dad.  If I don’t go today, it’ll be that much harder to make myself get up and do it tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got the, uh…”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got the tube of pepper spray in my pocket,” I said.  He bobbed his head in acknowledgement.  It was only moments later that I realized I didn’t have it.  The pepper spray was with my costume, in the coal chute in the basement.  I felt a pang of guilt at realizing I’d lied to my dad.\r\n\r\n“O.J.?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I’ll get it,” I said, heading to the fridge for the orange juice.  While I was at the fridge, I also grabbed some applesauce.  As I returned to the table, my dad slapped some french toast on the frying pan to join the bacon.  The room filled with the aroma of the cooking food.  I helped myself to the applesauce.\r\n\r\n“You know Gerry?” my dad asked.\r\n\r\nI shrugged.\r\n\r\n“You met him once or twice when you’ve visited me at work.  Big guy, burly, Black Irish?”\r\n\r\nShrugging again, I took a bite of french toast.  My dad was part of the Dockworkers Association, as the Union spokesperson and head of hiring.  With the state of the Docks being what they were, that meant my dad was pretty much in charge of telling everyone that there were no jobs to be had, day after day.\r\n\r\n“Rumor’s going around he found work.  Guess with who.”\r\n\r\n“Dunno,” I said, around a mouthful of food.\r\n\r\n“He’s going to be one of Über and Leet’s henchmen.”\r\n\r\nI raised my eyebrows.  Über and Leet were local villains with a video game theme.  They were pretty much as incompetent as villains could be while staying out of jail.  They barely even rated as B-list.\r\n\r\n“They going to make him wear a uniform?  Bright primary colors, Tron style?”\r\n\r\nMy dad chuckled, “Probably.”\r\n\r\n“We’re supposed to talk about how the powers thing has influenced our lives in class today.  Maybe I’ll mention that.”\r\n\r\nWe ate in silence for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n“I heard you come in late last night,” he said.\r\n\r\nI just gave him a small nod and took another bite of french toast, even as my heart rate tripled and my mind searched for excuses.\r\n\r\n“Like I said,” I finally opened my mouth, looking down at my plate, “I just couldn’t sleep.  I couldn’t get my thoughts to settle down.  I got out of bed and tried pacing, but it didn’t help, so I stepped outside and walked around the neighborhood.”  I wasn’t totally lying.  I’d had nights like that.  Last night just hadn’t been one of them, and I had gone walking around the neighborhood, even if it was in a different way than I’d implied.\r\n\r\n“Christ, Taylor,” my father answered, “This isn’t the kind of area where you can walk around in the middle of the night.”\r\n\r\n“I had the pepper spray,” I protested, lamely.  That wasn’t a lie, at least.\r\n\r\n“What if you get caught off guard?  What if the guy has a knife, or a gun?” my father asked.\r\n\r\nOr pyrokinesis and the ability to grow armor plating and claws?  I felt a little knot of ugliness in the pit of my stomach at my father’s concern for me.  It was all the more intense because it was so justified.  I had almost died last night.\r\n\r\n“What’s going on, that has you so anxious you can’t sleep?” he questioned me.\r\n\r\n“School,” I said, swallowing around a lump in my throat, “Friends, the lack thereof.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not better?” he asked, carefully stepping around the elephant in the room, the bullies.\r\n\r\nIf it was, I wouldn’t be having problems, would I?  I just gave him a one shoulder shrug and forced myself to take another bite of french toast.  My shoulder twinged a little as it made the bruises from last night felt.  As much as I didn’t feel like eating, I knew my stomach would be growling at me before lunch if I didn’t.  That was even without accounting for the energy I burned running, let alone the escapades of last night.\r\n\r\nWhen my dad realized I didn’t have an answer for him, he resumed eating.  He only had one bite before he put his fork down again with a clink on the plate.\r\n\r\n“No more going out in the middle of the night,” he said, “Or I’m putting a bell on the doors.”\r\n\r\nHe would, too.  I just nodded and promised myself I would be more careful.  When I had come in, I had been so tired and sore that I hadn’t given any thought to the click of the door, the rattle of the lock or the creaks of floorboards that were older than me.\r\n\r\n“Okay,” I said, adding, “I’m sorry.”  Even with that, I felt a twinge of guilt.  My apology was sincere in feeling, but I was making it with the knowledge that I would probably do the same thing again.  It felt wrong.\r\n\r\nHe gave me a smile that seemed almost like an unspoken ‘I’m sorry too’.\r\n\r\nI finished off my plate and stood up to put it in the sink and run water over it.\r\n\r\n“Going on your run?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” I said, put my dishes in the beaten up old dishwasher and bent down to give my dad a hug on my way to the door.\r\n\r\n“Taylor, have you been smoking?”\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n“Your hair is, uh, burnt.  At the ends, there.”\r\n\r\nI thought back to the previous night.  Getting hit in the back by one of Lung’s blasts of flame.\r\n\r\nShrugging, I suggested, “Stove, maybe?”\r\n\r\n“Be safe,” my dad said, emphasizing each word.  I took that as my cue to go, heading out the side door and breaking into an all out run the moment I was past the chain link gate at the side of the house.'),
('Insinuation 2', 'Worm', 9, 'The run had helped to wake me up, as did the hot shower and a cup of the coffee my dad had left in the pot.  Even so, the fatigue didn’t help the feeling of disorientation over just how normal the day seemed as I made my way to school.  Just a matter of hours ago, I had been in a life and death fight, I had even met Armsmaster.  Now it was a day like any other.\r\n\r\nI felt a bit nervous as I got to homeroom.  Having basically skipped two classes the previous Friday, failing to turn in a major assignment, I figured that Mrs. Knott probably knew already.  I didn’t feel relieved when Mrs. Knott glanced up at me and gave a tight smile before turning her attention back to her computer.  That just meant the humiliation would be redoubled if and when class was interrupted by someone coming down from the office.  A part of me just wanted to miss this class too, just to avoid the potential humiliation and avoid drawing attention.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I felt anxious as I made my way to my computer, which kind of sucked because Computer class was one of the few parts of the school day I didn’t usually dread.  For one thing, it was the one class in which I was doing well.  More to the point, neither Madison, Sophia nor Emma were in this class, though some of their friends were.  Those girls didn’t usually feel the need to harass me without the trio around, and I was further removed from them because I was in the advanced stream of the class.  A good three quarters of the people in the room were computer illiterate, being from families that didn’t have the money for computers or families that didn’t have much interest in the things, so they practiced typing without looking at the keyboard and had lessons in using search engines.  By contrast, I was in the group that was learning some basic programming and spreadsheets.  It didn’t do a lot for my already geeky reputation, but I could deal.\r\n\r\nMrs. Knott was an alright teacher, if not the most hands on; she was usually content to give us advanced students an in-class assignment and then focus on the more rambunctious majority for the rest of the class.  This suited me just fine – I usually wrapped up the assignment in a half hour, leaving me an hour to use as I saw fit.  I had been recalling and going over the events of the previous night during my morning run, and the first thing that I did when the ancient desktop finished its agonizing load process was to start digging for information.\r\n\r\nThe go-to place for news and discussion on capes was Parahumans Online.  The front page had constant updates on recent, international news featuring capes.  From there, I could go to the wiki, where there was information on individual capes, groups and events, or to the message boards, which broke down into nearly a hundred sub-boards, for specific cities and capes.  I opened the wiki in one tab, then found and opened the message board for Brockton Bay in another.\r\n\r\nI had the sense that either Tattletale or Grue were the leader of the group I had run into.  Turning my attention to Tattletale, I searched the wiki.  The result I got was disappointingly short, starting with a header reading “This article is a stub.  Be a hero and help us expand it.”  There was a one sentence blurb on how she was a alleged villain active in Brockton Bay, with a single blurry picture.  The only new information for me was that her costume was lavender.  A search of the message boards turned up absolutely nothing.  There wasn’t even a hint as to what her power was.\r\n\r\nI looked up Grue.  There was actually information about him, but nothing detailed or definitive.  The wiki stated he had been active for nearly three years, dealing in petty crimes such as robbing small stores and doing some work as an enforcer for those who wanted a little superpowered muscle along for a job.  Recently, he had turned to higher scale crime, including corporate theft and robbing a casino, together with his new team.  His power was listed as darkness generation in the sidebar under his picture.  The picture seemed crisp enough, but the focus of it, Grue, was just a blurry black silhouette in the center.\r\n\r\nI searched for Bitch, next.  No results.  I did another search for her more official title, Hellhound, and got a wealth of information.  Rachel Lindt had never made any real attempt to hide her identity.  She had apparently been homeless through most of her criminal career, just living on the streets and moving on whenever police or a cape came after her.  The sightings and encounters with the homeless girl ended around a year ago – I figured that was when she joined forces with Grue, Tattletale and Regent.  The picture in the sidebar was taken from surveillance camera footage – an unmasked, dark haired girl who I wouldn’t have called pretty.  She had a squarish, blunt-featured face with thick eyebrows.  She was riding atop one of her monstrous ‘dogs’ like a jockey rides a horse, down the middle lane of a street.\r\n\r\nAccording to the wiki entry, her powers manifested when she was fourteen, followed almost immediately by her demolishing the foster home she had been living in, injuring her foster mother and two other foster children in the process.  This was followed by a two year series of skirmishes and retreats across Maine as various heroes and teams tried to apprehend her, and she either defeated them or successfully evaded capture.  She had no powers that would have made her any stronger or faster than the average Jane, but she was apparently able to turn ordinary dogs into the creatures I had seen on the rooftop.  Monsters the size of a car, all muscle, bone, fang and claw.  A red box near the bottom of the page read, “Rachel Lindt has a public identity, but is known to be particularly hostile, antisocial and violent.  If recognized, do not approach or provoke.  Leave the area and notify authorities as to her last known location.”  At the very bottom of the page was a list of links that were related to her:  two fansites and a news article relating to her early activities.  A search of the message boards turned up too many results, leaving me unable to sift through the crap, the arguments, the speculation and the villain worship to find any genuine morsels of information.  If nothing else, she was notorious.  I sighed and moved on, making a mental note to do more investigation when I had the time.\r\n\r\nThe last member of the group was Regent.  Given what Armsmaster had said about the guy being low profile, I didn’t expect to find much.  I was surprised to find less than that.  Nothing.  My search on the wiki turned up only a default response, “There are no results matching this query.  32 unique IP addresses have searched the Parahumans.net Wiki  for ‘Regent’ in 2011.  Would you like to create the page?”  The message board didn’t turn up anything else.  I even did a search for alternate spellings of his name, such as Regence and Recant, in case I had heard it wrong.  Nothing turned up.\r\n\r\nIf my mood had been on the sour side as I got to homeroom, the dead ends only made it worse.  I turned my attention to the in-class assignment, making a working calculator in Visual Basic, but it was too trivial to distract me.  The work from Thursday and Friday had already given us the tools to do the job, so it was really just busywork.  I didn’t mind learning stuff, but work for the sake of doing work was annoying.  I did the bare minimum, checked it for any bugs, moved the file to the ‘completed work’ folder and returned to surfing the web.  All in all, the work barely took fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nI looked up Lung on the wiki, which I had done often enough before, as part of my research and preparation for being a superhero.  I’d wanted to be sure I knew who prominent local villains were and what they could do.  The search for ‘Lung’ redirected to a catch-all page on his gang, the ABB, with quite a bit of detailed information.  The information on Lung’s powers was pretty in line with my own experience, though there was no mention of the super-hearing or him being fireproof.  I debated adding it, but decided against it.  There were security concerns with my submission being tracked back to Winslow High, and then to me.  I figured it would probably be deleted as unsupported speculation, anyways.\r\n\r\nThe section beneath the description of Lung and his powers covered his subordinates.  He was estimated to have forty or fifty thugs working for him across Brockton Bay, largely drawn from the ranks of Asian youth.  It was pretty unconventional for a gang to include members of the variety of nationalities that the ABB did, but Lung had made it a mission to conquer and absorb every gang with Asian members and many without.  Once he had the manpower he needed, the non-Asian gangs were cannibalized for assets, their members discarded.  Even though there were no more major gangs in the east end of town to absorb, he was still recruiting zealously.  His method, now, was to go after anyone older than twelve and younger than sixty.  It didn’t matter if you were a gang member or not.  If you were Asian and you lived in Brockton Bay, Lung and his people expected you to either join or to pay tribute one way or another.  There had been local news reports on it, newspaper articles, and I could remember seeing signs in the guidance counselor’s office detailing where people who were targeted in this way could go for help.\r\n\r\nLung’s lieutenants were listed as Oni Lee and Bakuda.  I already had some general knowledge about Oni Lee, but I was intrigued to see there were recent updates to his wiki entry.  There were specific details on his powers:  He could teleport, but when he did so, he didn’t disappear.  As he teleported, his original self, for lack of a better term, would stay where it was and remain active for five to ten seconds before disintegrating into a cloud of carbon ash.  Essentially, he could create another version of himself anywhere nearby, while the old version could stick around long enough to distract or attack you.  If that wasn’t scary enough, there was an report of him holding a grenade in his hand as he repeatedly duplicated himself, with his short lived duplicates acting as suicide bombers.  Topping it all off, Oni Lee’s wiki page  had a similar red warning box to the one that Bitch/Hellhound had on hers, minus the bit about his public identity.  From what they knew about him, authorities had seen fit to note him a sociopath.  The warning covered the same essential elements: exceedingly violent, dangerous to approach, should not be provoked, and so on.  I glanced at his picture.  His costume consisted of a black bodysuit with a black bandoleer and belt for his knives, guns and grenades.  The only color on him was an ornate Japanese-style demon mask, crimson with two green stripes down either side.  Except for the mask, his costume gave off the distinct impression of a ninja, which just added weight to the notion that this was a guy who could and would slide a knife between your ribs.\r\n\r\nBakuda was a new entry, added to the ABB wiki page just ten days ago.  The picture only showed her from the shoulders up, a girl with straight black hair, large opaque goggles over her eyes and a metal mask with a gas mask styled filter covering the lower half of her face.  A braided cord of black, yellow and green wires looped over one of her shoulders.  I couldn’t pinpoint her ethnicity with the mask and goggles, and her age wasn’t any easier to figure out.\r\n\r\nThe wiki had a lot of the same details Armsmaster had mentioned to me.  Bakuda had essentially held a university ransom and she did it with her superhuman ability to design and fabricate high tech bombs.  There was a link to a video titled ‘Bomb Threat @ Cornell’, but I didn’t think it wise to play it in school, especially without headphones.  I made a mental note to check it out when I got home.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that caught my eye was the section heading titled ‘Defeats and Captures’.  I scrolled down to read it.  According to the wiki, Lung had apparently suffered a number of minor defeats at the hands of various teams, ranging from the Guild to the local teams of New Wave, the Wards and the Protectorate, but consistently managed to evade capture until last night.  A blurb read, ‘ Armsmaster successfully ambushed and defeated the leader of the ABB, who was weakened from a recent encounter with a rival gang.  Lung was taken to the PHQ for holding until the villain’s trial by teleconference.  Given Lung’s extensive and well documented criminal history, it is expected he will face imprisonment in the Birdcage should he be found guilty at trial.’\r\n\r\nI took a deep breath and let it out slowly.  I wasn’t sure what to think.  By all rights, I should have been angry that Armsmaster took the credit for the fight that could have cost me my life.  Instead, I felt a building excitement.  I felt like shaking the shoulder of the guy sitting next to me and point to the screen, saying, “Me, I made that possible!  Me!”\r\n\r\nWith a renewed enthusiasm, I switched tabs to the message board and began looking to see what people were saying about it.  A post by a fan or minion of Lung threatened violence against Armsmaster.  There was a request by someone asking for more information on the fight.  I was given pause by one post that asked whether Bakuda could or would use a large scale bomb and the threat of potentially thousands or hundreds of thousands dead, to ransom Lung back.\r\n\r\nI tried to put that out of my mind.  If it happened, it would be the responsibility of heroes better and more experienced than I.\r\n\r\nIt struck me that there was one person I hadn’t looked for.  Myself.  I opened up the advanced search page for the Parahumans.net message board and did a search for multiple terms.  I included insect, spider, swarm, bug, plague, and a mess of other terms that had struck me when I had been trying to brainstorm a good hero name.  I narrowed the timeframe of posts to search for posts made within the past 12 hours and hit Search.\r\n\r\nMy efforts turned up two posts.  One referred to a villain called Pestilence, active in the UK.  Apparently Pestilence was one of the people who could use ‘magic’.  That is, he was if you believed magic was real, and not just some convoluted or deluded interpretation of a given set of powers.\r\n\r\nThe second post was in the ‘Connections’ section of the message board, where rescued damsels left their contact information for their dashing heroes, where conventions and fan gatherings were organized and where people posted job offers for capes and the cape-obsessed.  Most were cryptic or vague, referring to stuff only the people in question would know.\r\n\r\nThe message was titled, simply, “Bug”\r\n\r\nI clicked it and waited impatiently for the outdated system and overloaded school modem to load up the page.  What I got was brief.\r\n\r\nSubject: Bug\r\n\r\nOwe you one.  Would like to repay the favor.  Meet?\r\n\r\nSend a message,\r\n\r\nTt.\r\n\r\nThe post was followed by two pages of people commenting.  Three people suggested it was something important, while a half dozen more people decried them as tinfoil hats, Parahumans.net’s term for conspiracy theorists.\r\n\r\nIt was meaningful, though.  I couldn’t interpret it any other way; Tattletale had found a way to get in contact with me.'),
('Insinuation 3', 'Worm', 10, 'I didn’t have any time to contemplate the message I’d received from Tattletale.  The bell rang and I had to hurry to properly log off and shut down before heading to my next class.  As I gathered my stuff, I realized I had been so caught up in researching on the villains I’d met last night and in Tattletale’s message that I had forgotten to worry about getting into trouble for skipping class.  I felt a kind of resignation as I realized I would have to face the music later in the day, anyways.\r\n\r\nMadison was already in her seat as I got to the classroom.  She had a pair of girls crouching by either side of her desk, and all three of them broke into giggles as they saw me.  Bitches.\r\n\r\nMy seat of choice was the far right, front row, closest to the door.  Lunch hour and immediately after school was when the trio tended to give me the hardest time, so I tried to sit as close as possible to the door, for a quick escape.  I spotted a puddle of orange juice on the seat, with the empty plastic bottle lying just underneath the chair.  Madison was going for a two for one.  It was both a ‘prank’ and a reminder of how they had doused me with juice and soft drinks last Friday.  Irritated, I carefully avoided looking at  Madison and took an empty seat a few rows back.\r\n\r\nMr Gladly entered the room, he was short and young enough you could almost mistake him for another high school student.  It took a few minutes for him to start the class, and he immediately ordered us to break into groups of four to share our homework with one another and to prepare to share it with the rest of the class.  The group that had the most to contribute would win the prize he had mentioned on Friday, treats from the vending machine.\r\n\r\nIt was stuff like this that made Mr. Gladly my least favorite teacher.  I got the impression he’d be surprised to hear he was anyone’s least favorite teacher, but that was just one more point against him in my book.  I don’t think he comprehended why people might not like him, or how miserable group work was when you didn’t identify with any of the groups or cliques in the school.  He just figured people liked doing group work because it let them talk and hang out with their friends in class.\r\n\r\nWhile the class got sorted, I figured I’d avoid standing around like a loser with no group to join and get something else out of the way. I approached the desk at the front of the room.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Gladly?”\r\n\r\n“Call me Mr. G.  Mr. Gladly is my dad,” he informed me with a sort of mock sternness.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, uh, Mr. G.  I need a new textbook.”\r\n\r\nHe gave me a curious look, “What happened to your old one?”\r\n\r\nSoaked with grape juice by a trio of harpies.  “I lost it,” I lied.\r\n\r\n“Replacement textbooks are thirty five dollars.  I don’t expect it now, but…”\r\n\r\n“I’ll have it for you by the end of the week,” I finished for him.\r\n\r\nHe handed me a textbook, and I looked over the room before joining the only group with room for more: Sparky and Greg.  We had been in a group several times before, as the leftovers when all the friends and cliques had banded together.\r\n\r\nSparky had apparently picked up his nickname when a third grade teacher used it in an ironic sense, and it had stuck, to the point where I doubted anyone but his own mother even knew his real name.  He was a drummer, long haired, and was so out of touch with reality that you could stop talking in the middle of a sentence and he wouldn’t notice.  He just went through life in a daze, presumably until he could do his thing, which was his band.\r\n\r\nGreg was just the opposite.  He was smarter than average, but he had a way of saying every thought that came into his head – his train of thought didn’t have any brakes.  Or tracks.  It would have been easier to be in a group with just Sparky and essentially do the work by myself than it would be to work with Greg.\r\n\r\nI got my share of the homework out of my new backpack.  Mr. Gladly had asked us to come up with a list of ways that capes had influenced society.  In between the various steps of my getting ready for my first night out in costume, I had taken the time to fix up my art project and had come up with a fairly comprehensive list for Mr. Gladly’s homework.  I had even used newspaper and magazine clippings to support my points.  I felt pretty good about it.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t get much done,” Greg said, “I got distracted by this new game I got and it is really really good, it’s called Space Opera, have you played it?”\r\n\r\nA full minute later he was still on the same topic, even though I wasn’t playing any attention to him or giving him any feedback on what he was saying, “…you have to understand it’s a genre, and it’s one I’ve really been getting into it lately, since I started watching this anime called – Oh, hey, Julia!”  Greg broke off from his monologue to wave with enough energy and excitement that I felt a little embarrassed to just be sitting next to him.  I turned in my seat to see one of Madison’s friends coming in, late.\r\n\r\n“Can I be in Madison’s group?” Julia asked Mr. Gladly.\r\n\r\n“That wouldn’t be fair.  Greg’s group only has three people.  Help them,” Mr. Gladly said.\r\n\r\nJulia walked over to where we were sitting and made a face.  Just loud enough for us to hear, she muttered a disgusted, “Ew.”  I felt much the same about her joining us.\r\n\r\nIt was downhill from there.  Madison’s group moved so the four of them were sitting right next to our group, which let Julia talk with them while still sitting with us.  The presence of all the popular and attractive girls in the class just got Greg more wound up, and he began trying to insert himself into their conversation, only to get shut down or ignored.  It was embarrassing to watch.\r\n\r\n“Greg,” I said, trying to distract him from the other group, “Here’s what I did over the weekend.  What do you think?”\r\n\r\nI handed him the work I had done.  To his credit, he gave it a serious read.\r\n\r\n“This is really good, Taylor,” He said, when he was done.\r\n\r\n“Let me see,” Julia said.  Before I could stop him, Greg dutifully handed my work over to her.  I watched her glance over it, then toss it onto Madison’s table.  There were a few giggles.\r\n\r\n“Give that back,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Give what back?” Julia said.\r\n\r\n“Madison,” I said, ignoring Julia, “Give it back.”\r\n\r\nMadison, cute and petite and crush of choice for half the guys in our grade, turned and managed a combined look and tone of such condescension that a grown man would have flinched, “Nobody is talking to you, Taylor.”\r\n\r\nThat was that.  Short of running to the teacher and complaining, I wasn’t going to get my work back, and anyone who considered that an option has clearly never been in high school.  Greg looked between me and the girls with a kind of panic before settling into a funk, Sparky had his head down on his desk, either asleep or close to it, and I was left fuming.  I made an attempt at trying to to salvage things, but getting Greg to focus was impossible, as he constantly tried to apologize and made lame attempts to convince the other group to give my work back.  Our time ran out, and Mr. Gladly picked out people from each group to stand up and go over what they had come up with.\r\n\r\nI sighed as Mr. Gladly picked Greg to do our group’s presentation, and was forced to watch Greg botch it badly enough that Mr. Gladly asked him to sit down before he was finished.  Greg was one of those kids I always figured made teachers groan inwardly when they raised their hands in class.  The sort of kid that took twice as long to answer as anyone else, and was often only half-right or so off-tangent that it derailed the discussion.  I couldn’t imagine what had possessed Mr. Gladly to pick Greg to do our group’s presentation.\r\n\r\nWhat made things worse was that I then got to watch Madison rattle off my very impressive sounding list of ways capes had changed the world.  She cribbed almost all of my stuff; fashion, economics, Tinkers and the tech boom, the fact that movies, television and magazines had been tweaked to accommodate cape celebrities, and so on.  Still, she got it wrong when explaining how law enforcement had changed.  My point had been that with qualified capes easing the workload and taking over for most high profile crises, law enforcement of all stripes were more free to train and expand their skill sets, making for smarter, more versatile cops.  Madison just made it sound like they got a lot of vacation days.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladly named another group as the winners, by virtue of the sheer number of things they had come up with, though he made a point of saying the quality of Madison’s work was nearly good enough to count.  From there, he moved on to his lecture.\r\n\r\nI was steamed and I could hardly focus on the lecture, as my power crackled and tugged at my attention from the periphery of my consciousness, making me acutely aware of every bug within a tenth of a mile.  I could tune it out, but the extra concentration that took, coupled with the anger I felt towards Madison and Mr. Gladly, was distracting enough that I couldn’t focus on the lecture.  I took a cue from Sparky and put my head down on the desk.  Being as exhausted from the previous night’s activity as I was, it was all I could do to keep from dozing off.  Still, spending the class half asleep made it go by faster.  I was startled when the bell rang.\r\n\r\nAs everyone gathered their things and began to file out, Mr. Gladly approached me and quietly said, “I’d like you to stick around for a few minutes, please.”\r\n\r\nI just nodded and put my books away, then waited for the teacher to finish negotiating where to meet the prize winners from the class contest so he could pay for their prizes.\r\n\r\nWhen it was just me and Mr. Gladly in the classroom, he cleared his throat and then told me, “I’m not stupid, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Okay,” I replied, not sure how to respond.\r\n\r\n“I have something of an idea of what goes on in my classroom.  I don’t know exactly who, but I know some people are giving you a pretty hard time.”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I saw the mess left on your usual seat today.  I remember a few weeks back when glue was smeared on your desk and chair.  There was also the incident that happened at the start of the year.  All of your teachers had a meeting about that.”\r\n\r\nI couldn’t meet his gaze as he brought that last event up.  I looked at my feet.\r\n\r\n“And I’m guessing there’s more that I don’t know about?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” I said, still looking down.  It was hard to explain how I felt about this conversation.  I was gratified, I think, that someone had brought it up, but annoyed that that someone was Mr. Gladly.  I felt kind of embarrassed too, like I had walked into a door and someone was trying too hard to make sure I was okay.\r\n\r\n“I asked you after the glue incident.  I’m asking you again.  Would you be willing to go to the office with me, to talk with the principal and vice principal?”\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments of consideration, I looked up and asked him, “What would happen?”\r\n\r\n“We’d have a discussion about what’s been going on.  You would name the person or people you believe responsible, and each of them would be called in to talk to the principal, in turn.”\r\n\r\n“And they’d get expelled?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladly shook his head, “If there was enough proof, they would be suspended for several days, unless they’ve done something very serious.  Further offenses could lead to longer suspensions or expulsion.”\r\n\r\nI gave a rueful chuckle, feeling the frustration welling up, “Great.  So they might miss a few days of school, and only if I can prove they were behind it all… and whether they get suspended or not, they feel a hundred percent justified in whatever else they do to the rat for revenge.”\r\n\r\n“If you want things to get better, Taylor, you have to start somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“That isn’t a starting point.  It’s shooting myself in the foot,” I said, pulling my bag over my shoulder.  When he didn’t immediately respond, I left the classroom.\r\n\r\nEmma, Madison, Sophia and a half dozen other girls were standing in the hall, waiting for me.');

('Interlude 1', 'Worm', 7, '“We don’t know how long he had been there.  Suspended in the air above the Atlantic Ocean.  On May twentieth, 1982, an ocean liner was crossing from Plymouth to Boston when a passenger spotted him.  He was naked, his arms to his sides, his long hair blowing in the wind as he stood in the sky, nearly a hundred feet above the gently cresting waves.  His skin and hair can only be described as a burnished gold.  With neither body hair nor clothes to cover him, it is said, he seemed almost artificial.\r\n\r\n“After a discussion including passenger and crew, the liner detoured to get closer.  It was a sunny day, and passengers crowded to the railings to get a better look.  As if sharing their curiosity, the figure drew closer as well.  His expression was unchanging, but witnesses at the scene reported that he appeared deeply sad.\r\n\r\n“‘I thought he was going to crack his facade and cry any moment’, said Grace Lands, ‘But when I reached out and touched his fingertips, I was the one who burst into tears.’\r\n\r\n“‘That boat trip was a final journey for me.  I had cancer, and I wasn’t brave enough to face it.  Can’t believe I’m admitting this in front of a camera, but I was going back to Boston, where I was born, to end things myself.  After I met him, I changed my mind.  Didn’t matter anyways.  I went to a doctor, and he said there was no sign I ever had the disease.’\r\n\r\n“‘My brother, Andrew Hawke, was the last passenger to make any sort of contact with him, I remember.  He climbed up onto the railing, and, almost falling off, he clasped the hand of the golden man.  The rest of us had to grab onto him to keep him from falling.  Whatever happened left him with a quiet awe.  When the man with the golden skin flew away, my brother stayed silent.  The rest of the way to Boston, my brother didn’t say a word.  When we docked, and the spell finally broke, my brother babbled his excitement to reporters like a child.’\r\n\r\n“The golden man would reappear several more times in the coming months and years.  At some point, he donned clothing.  At first, a sheet worn over one shoulder and pinned at either side of the waist, then more conventional clothes.  In 1999, he donned the white bodysuit he still wears today.  For more than a decade, we have wondered, where did our golden man get these things?  Who was he in contact with?\r\n\r\n“Periodically at first, then with an increasing frequency, the golden man started to intervene in times of crisis.  For events as small as a car accident, as great as natural disasters, he has arrived and used his abilities to save us.  A flash of light to freeze water reinforcing a levee stressed by a hurricane.  A terrorist act averted.  A serial murderer caught.  A volcano quelled.  Miracles, it was said.\r\n\r\n“His pace increased, perhaps because he was still learning what he could do, perhaps because he was getting a greater sense of where he was needed.  By the middle of the 1990s, he was traveling from crisis to crisis, flying faster than the speed of sound.  In fifteen years, he has not rested.\r\n\r\n“He has been known to speak just once in thirty years.  After extinguishing widespread fire in Alexandrovsk, he paused to survey the scene and be sure no blazes remained.  A reporter spoke to him, and asked, ‘Kto vy?’ – what are you?\r\n\r\n“Shocking the world, caught on camera in a scene replayed innumerable times, he answered in a voice that sounded as though it might never have uttered a sound before.  Barely audible, he told her, ‘Scion’.\r\n\r\n“It became the name we used for him.  Ironic, because we took a word that meant descendant, and used it to name the first of many superpowered individuals – parahumans – to appear across Earth.\r\n\r\n“Just five years after Scion’s first appearance, the superheroes emerged from the cover of rumor and secrecy to show themselves to the public.  Though the villains followed soon after, it was the heroes who shattered any illusions of the parahumans being divine figures.  In 1989, attempting to quell a riot over a basketball game in Michigan, the superhero known to the public as Vikare stepped in, only to be clubbed over the head.  He died not long after of a brain embolism.  Later, he would be revealed to be Andrew Hawke.\r\n\r\n“The golden age of the parahumans was thus short lived.  They were not the deific figures they had appeared to be.  Parahumans were, after all, people with powers, and people are flawed at their core.  Government agencies took a firmer hand, and state-”\r\n\r\nThe television flicked off, and the screen went black, cutting the documentary off mid sentence.  Danny Hebert sighed and sat down on the bed, only to stand just a moment later and resume pacing.\r\n\r\nIt was three fifteen in the morning, and his daughter Taylor was not in her bedroom.\r\n\r\nDanny ran his hands through his hair, which was thinned enough at the top to be closer to baldness than not.  He liked to be the first to arrive at work, watching everyone arrive, having them know he was there for them.  So he usually went to bed early; he’d turn in at ten in the evening, give or take depending on what was on TV.  Only tonight, a little past midnight, he’d been disturbed from restless sleep when he had felt rather than heard the shutting of the back door of the house, just below his bedroom.  He had checked on his daughter, and he’d found her room empty.\r\n\r\nSo he had waited for his daughter to return for three hours.\r\n\r\nCountless times, he had glanced out the window, hoping to see Taylor coming in.\r\n\r\nFor the twentieth time, he felt the urge to ask his wife for help, for advice, for support.  But her side of the bed was empty and it had been for some time.  Daily, it seemed, he was struck by the urge to call her cell phone.  He knew it was stupid – she wouldn’t pick up – and if he dwelt on that for too long, he became angry at her, which just made him feel worse.\r\n\r\nHe wondered, even as he knew the answer, why he hadn’t gotten Taylor a cell phone.  Danny didn’t know what his daughter was doing, what would drive her to go out at night.  She wasn’t the type.  He could tell himself that most fathers felt that way about their daughters, but at the same time, he knew.  Taylor wasn’t social.  She didn’t go to parties, she wouldn’t drink, she wasn’t even that interested in champagne when they celebrated the New Year together.\r\n\r\nTwo ominous possibilities kept nagging at him, both too believable.  The first was that Taylor had gone out for fresh air, or even for a run.  She wasn’t happy, especially at school, he knew, and exercise was her way of working through it.  He could see her doing it on a Sunday night, with a fresh week at school looming.  He liked that her running made her feel better about herself, that she seemed to be doing it in a reasonable, healthy way. He just hated that she had to do it here, in this neighborhood.  Because here, a skinny girl in her mid-teens was an easy target for attack.  A mugging or worse – he couldn’t even articulate the worst of the possibilities in his own thoughts without feeling physically sick.  If she had gone out at eleven in the evening for a run and hadn’t come back by three in the morning, then it meant something had happened.\r\n\r\nHe glanced out the window again, at that corner of the house where the pool of illumination beneath the streetlight would let him see her approaching.  Nothing.\r\n\r\nThe second possibility wasn’t much better.  He knew Taylor was being bullied.  Danny had found that out in January, when his little girl had been pulled out of school and taken to the hospital.  Not the emergency room, but the psychiatric ward.  She wouldn’t say by whom, but under the influence of the drugs they had given her to calm down, she had admitted she was being victimized by bullies, using the plural to give him a clue that it was a they and not a he or a she.  She hadn’t mentioned it – the incident or the bullying – since.  If he pushed, she only tensed up and grew more withdrawn.  He had resigned himself to letting her reveal the details in her own time, but months had passed without any hints or clues being offered.\r\n\r\nThere was precious little Danny could do on the subject, either.  He had threatened to sue the school after his daughter had been taken to the hospital, and the school board had responded by settling, paying her hospital bills and promising they would look out for her to prevent such events from occurring in the future. It was a feeble promise made by a chronically overworked staff and it didn’t do a thing to ease his worries.  His efforts to have her change schools had been stubbornly countered with rules and regulations about the maximum travel times a student was allowed to have between home and a given school.  The only other school within a reasonable distance of Taylor’s place of residence was Arcadia High, and it was already desperately overcrowded with more than two hundred students on a list requesting admittance.\r\n\r\nWith all that in mind, when his daughter disappeared until the middle of the night, he couldn’t shake the idea that the bullies might have lured her out with blackmail, threats or empty promises.  He only knew about the one incident, the one that had landed her in the hospital, but it had been grotesque.  It had been implied, but never elaborated on, that more had been going on.  He could imagine these boys or girls that were tormenting his daughter, egging one another on as they came up with more creative ways to humiliate or harm her.  Taylor hadn’t said as much aloud, but whatever had been going on had been mean, persistent and threatening enough that Emma, Taylor’s closest friend for years, had stopped spending time with her.  It galled him.\r\n\r\nImpotent.  Danny was helpless where it counted.  There was no action he could take – his one call to the police at two in the morning had only earned him a tired explanation that the police couldn’t act or look for her without something more to go on.  If his daughter was still gone after twelve hours, he’d been told, he should call them again.  All he could do was wait and pray with his heart in his throat that the phone wouldn’t ring, a police officer or nurse on the other end ready to tell him what had happened to his daughter.\r\n\r\nThe slightest of vibrations in the house marked the escape of the warm air in the house to the cold outdoors, and there was a muffled whoosh as the kitchen door shut again.  Danny Hebert felt a thrill of relief coupled with abject fear.  If he went downstairs to find his daughter, would he find her hurting or hurt?  Or would his presence make things worse, her own father seeing her at her most vulnerable after humiliation at the hands of bullies?  She had told him, in every way except articulating it aloud, that she didn’t want that.  She had pleaded with him, with body language and averted eye contact, unfinished sentences and things left unsaid, not to ask, not to push, not to see, when it came to the bullying.  He couldn’t say why, exactly.  Home was an escape from that, he’d suspected, and if he recognized the bullying, made it a reality here, maybe she wouldn’t have that relief from it.  Perhaps it was shame, that his daughter didn’t want him to see her like that, didn’t want to be that weak in front of him.  He really hoped that wasn’t the case.\r\n\r\nSo he ran his fingers through his hair once more and sat down on the corner of the bed, elbows on his knees, hands on his head, and stared at his closed bedroom door.  His ears were peeled for the slightest clue.  The house was old, and it hadn’t been a high quality building when it had been new, so the walls were thin and the structure prone to making noise at every opportunity.  There was the faintest sound of a door closing downstairs.  The bathroom?  It wouldn’t be the basement door, with no reason for her to go down there, and he couldn’t imagine it was a closet, because after two or three minutes, the same door opened and closed again.\r\n\r\nAfter something banged on the kitchen counter, there was little but the occasional groan of floorboards.  Five or ten minutes after she had come in, there was the rhythmic creak of the stairs as she ascended.  Danny thought about clearing his throat to let her know he was awake and available should she knock on his door, but decided against it.  He was being cowardly, he thought, as if his clearing of his throat would give reality to his fears.\r\n\r\nHer door shut carefully, almost inaudibly, with the slightest tap of door on doorframe.  Danny stood, abruptly, opening his door, ready to cross the hall and knock on her door.  To verify that his daughter was okay.\r\n\r\nHe was stopped by the smell of jam and toast.  She had made a late night snack.  It filled him with relief.  He couldn’t imagine his daughter, after being mugged, tormented or humiliated, coming home to have toast with jam as a snack.  Taylor was okay, or at least, okay enough to be left alone.\r\n\r\nHe let out a shuddering sigh of relief and retreated to his room to sit on the bed.\r\n\r\nRelief became anger.  He was angry at Taylor, for making him worry, and then not even going out of her way to let him know she was okay.  He felt a smouldering resentment towards the city, for having neighborhoods and people he couldn’t trust his daughter to.  He hated the bullies that preyed on his daughter.  Underlying it all was frustration with himself.  Danny Hebert was the one person he could control in all of this, and Danny Hebert had failed to do anything that mattered.  He hadn’t gotten answers, hadn’t stopped the bullies, hadn’t protected his daughter.  Worst of all was the idea that this might have happened before, with him simply sleeping through it rather than laying awake.\r\n\r\nHe stopped himself from walking into his daughter’s room, from shouting at her and demanding answers, even if it was what he wanted, more than anything.  Where had she been, what had she been doing?  Was she hurt?  Who were these people that were tormenting her?  He knew that by confronting her and getting angry at her, he would do more harm than good, would threaten to sever any bond of trust they had forged between them.\r\n\r\nDanny’s father had been a powerful, heavyset man, and Danny hadn’t gotten any of those genes.  Danny had been a nerd when the term was still young in popular culture, stick thin, awkward, short sighted, glasses, bad fashion sense.  What he had inherited was his father’s famous temper.  It was quick to rise and startling in its intensity.  Unlike his father, Danny had only ever hit someone in anger twice, both times when he was much younger.  That said, just like his father, he could and would go off on tirades that would leave people shaking.  Danny had long viewed the moment he’d started to see himself as a man, an adult, to be the point in time where he had sworn to himself that he wouldn’t ever lose his temper with his family.  He wouldn’t pass that on to his child the way his father had to him.\r\n\r\nHe had never broken that oath with Taylor, and knowing that was what kept him contained in his room, pacing back and forth, red in the face and wanting to punch something.  While he’d never gotten angry at her, never screamed at her, he knew Taylor had seen him angry.  Once, he had been at work, talking to a mayor’s aide.  The man had told Danny that the revival projects for the Docks were being cancelled and that, contrary to promises, there were to be layoffs rather than new jobs for the already beleaguered Dockworkers.  Taylor had been spending the morning in his office on the promise that they would go out for the afternoon, and had been in a position to see him fly off the handle in the worst way with the man.  Four years ago, he had lost his temper with Annette for the first time, breaking his oath to himself.  That had been the last time he had seen her.  Taylor hadn’t been there to see him shouting at her mother, but he was fairly certain she’d heard some of it.  It shamed him.\r\n\r\nThe third and last time that he had lost his temper where Taylor had been in a position to know had been when she had been hospitalized following the incident in January.  He’d screamed at the school’s principal, who had deserved it, and at Taylor’s then-Biology teacher, who probably hadn’t.  It had been bad enough that a nurse had threatened to call for a police officer, and Danny, barely mollified, had stomped from the hallway to the hospital room to find his daughter more or less conscious and wide eyed in reaction.  Danny harbored a deep fear that the reason Taylor hadn’t offered any details on the bullying was out of fear he would, in blind rage, do something about it.  It made him feel sick, the notion that he might have contributed something to his daughter’s self imposed isolation in how she was dealing with her problems.\r\n\r\nIt took Danny a long time to calm down, helped by telling himself over and over that Taylor was okay, that she was home, that she was safe.  It was something of a blessing that, as the anger faded, he felt drained.  He climbed into the left side of the bed, leaving the right side empty out of a habit he’d yet to break, and pulled the covers up around himself.\r\n\r\nHe would talk to Taylor in the morning.  Get an answer of some sort.\r\n\r\nHe dreamed of the ocean.'),
('Learning Skills I', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 6, 'I woke up in the evening feeling drained and exhausted, but no longer nearly so actively upset. I reflexively checked my timer – 55 hours to go – before remembering that it seemed like skills and magic weren’t going to be for me. What was the point. I flipped over in bed, stuck my head under the pillow, and moped some more.\r\n\r\nI was clearly not going to earn myself the [Stealth] skill anytime soon since dad heard me and entered the room.\r\n\r\n“Hey kiddo,” he said “How’re you feeling?”\r\n\r\nI grunted back. How did he think I was feeling?\r\n\r\n“Hey, so I know you’re upset, but it’ll be ok! Most everyone learns their skills from their parents anyways, or picks them up as they go along. You’ll be fine! Julia will teach you eeeeeeeeeeverything you’ll need to know!”\r\n\r\nI sat up in bed, picked up my pillow, and threw it at him. It wasn’t a great shot, and it was just a pillow, but the message was clear.\r\n\r\n“Ok, Ok, I get it” he said chuckling “I talked with mom. After you’ve unlocked the system, you can come with me for a few days while I do my rounds, and we’ll see what we can do with picking up skills. After all, you can try to get carpentry by sticking a knife in the block of wood at the temple, or you could’ve a real live [Carpenter] show you how it’s done until you get the skill! Doesn’t that sound so much better?”\r\n\r\nI perked up, not believing my ears. Not only would I get to try all sorts of fun things, I was almost guaranteed to get the skill? That sounded great! A small part of me whispered that I should still be upset over my treatment at the temple, that it was still unfair to girls everywhere that we were denied that chance, but I was far too excited to listen to that voice. Right now.\r\n\r\n“Yay dad you’re the best!” I jumped up to hug him “I can’t wa-“ *GURGLEGURGLEGURLE*\r\n\r\nI went beet red as my stomach rebelled, informing me in no uncertain terms that I needed to eat.\r\n\r\nDad laughed. “Julia also mentioned that you didn’t have lunch. Come on, let’s go get some dinner together.”\r\n\r\nWeee! Getting dinner with dad meant we weren’t cooking – it meant we were going to raid a food stand! I needed a good raiding hat. Maybe a raiding party.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go!” I bolted out of the room, out of the door, and was about to turn down the street when-\r\n\r\n“Elaine! Your sandals!”\r\n\r\nAh right, those. I sighed, turned about, and put my sandals on as dad caught up.\r\n\r\n“Here” He handed me four iron coins. “You’ll be deciding and buying today. Ok?”\r\n\r\nBetter and better! I was always considered too young to do the shopping – the most I did was tag along. Now I finally had money! The world was my oyster! Muwahahahahahahaha. I rubbed my hands together, plotting.\r\n\r\nI played with the coins dad gave me, turning them over in my hands. They were circular, with a triangular hole in the middle. I traced my finger over the ridges outside of the coin, then stuck my finger into the hole in the middle, feeling the ridges on the inside as well. I had always wondered -\r\n\r\n“Dad, why do the coins have holes?”\r\n\r\n“Smart girl! It’s so you can thread them onto a rod, see?” Taking a coin from me, he took one of the long triangular rods by the wall and threaded the coin onto it. “It’s hard to carry and deal with a bunch of money at once, and at a certain point a coin pouch won’t do it anymore. So, we thread them onto a rod instead! 64 coins on a metal pole make a rod.”\r\n\r\nHe took the coins off the rod and handed them back to me. We left the house, and almost immediately got ambushed by my favorite person in the world!\r\n\r\n“Lyra!” I waved at her.\r\n\r\n“Elaine! Yay!” She bounced over. “Time to play?”\r\n\r\nI glanced at dad, who simply arched an eyebrow at me.\r\n\r\n“Gotta get lunch. Dad’s making me buy!”\r\n\r\n“Oooh, nice! Can I come?”\r\n\r\nI looked at dad again, who looked sad for some reason.\r\n\r\n“Of course you can come with us Lyra.” He said.\r\n\r\nWhy would he be sad at Lyra coming with us? It was Lyra! Eating with her was always more fun, even if she stole my food half the time.\r\n\r\nThe street we were on had some vendors, but I was filthy rich now, and I wanted to hunt bigger game. Rolling the coins in my hand, we wandered down the main road while I let my nose try to find the best smelling vendor.\r\n\r\nI was only a liiiiiiiitle distracted by Lyra.\r\n\r\n“Let’s play in the park later! Soldiers vs Formorians!” Lyra punched the air a few times, shadowboxing invisible enemies in the grey zone.\r\n\r\n“Your mother won’t be happy if you come back home with another black eye.” Dad warned me.\r\n\r\n“She won’t!” Lyra jumped in between dad and I, pretending to thrust an invisible spear at him. “I’ll defend her! Ha! Ya!”\r\n\r\n“And Lyra’s mom won’t get mad at her for coming home with a black eye!” I added in. “It’s perfect!”\r\n\r\nDad looked upset. I dunno why, it seemed like a perfectly good plan, and black eyes healed anyways.\r\n\r\nPlus, mom was a super cool healer! She always fixed us up.\r\n\r\nI was the only one that got a lecture for it though.\r\n\r\nEventually my dogged pursuit of tasty food led us to a stall, where I stared up at the man tending the stall.\r\n\r\n“Two pitas please!” I asked in my best not-a-kid-anymore voice. He looked down at me, looked up at my dad. Smiled.\r\n\r\n“That’ll be five iron coins please.” My face fell. I turned around and looked pleadingly at dad, who just raised an eyebrow, mouth studiously still. Lyra was practically drooling at the food.\r\n\r\nI turned back, determined to separate the vendor from his delicious smelling food, puffed out my chest, and insisted “Four iron coins! All I have!”\r\n\r\nDad facepalmed while the vendor laughed.\r\n\r\n“Deal” he quickly insisted, and I had the sudden feeling that I’d been had. I reluctantly handed over the entirety of my dragon’s hoard, and greedily grabbed the pitas.\r\n\r\nWhirling around, I looked at dad and Lyra a bit awkwardly.\r\n\r\n“Ummm… oops.” My mind raced, and I came to the only logical conclusion.\r\n\r\n“Here!” I offered dad and Lyra one of the pitas each, ignoring my traitorous stomach loudly rebelling.\r\n\r\nDeath to traitors! We threw them into the gladiator pits here! My stomach would be glorious entertainment for the unwashed masses!\r\n\r\nWhich definitely wasn’t me. Nope.\r\n\r\nDad pushed his back to me.\r\n\r\n“I’m fine kiddo, eat up!”\r\n\r\nLyra had wolfed down the portion I offered her, and was practically done by the time I got my first bite in.\r\n\r\n“Oh thanks Elaine, that was great!” She practically rammed into me, hugging me with one arm as she licked her other hand clean. “You’re the absolute best!”\r\n\r\n“No you!”\r\n\r\nWe debated the merits of who was the better friend as we wandered back home.\r\n\r\n“Well! This is goodbye for now! Come out and play when you can!” Lyra cheerfully waved and skipped down the street.\r\n\r\nAfter a nice meal, dad sighed, and fully reclined on the recliner.\r\n\r\n“You know kiddo,” he started, “you overpaid at the vendor’s. Should’ve only been two, maybe three coins.” I was shocked. Shocked! I got cheated? Wait, dad LET me get cheated? He was a guard! He was supposed to stop that type of thing!\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you say anything?” I glumly muttered, visions of my hoard being separated from me unjustly swimming through my mind.\r\n\r\n“Because you’d never learn otherwise. It’s one thing to hear about it, to be told it, and another to experience it. Plus, the vendor overcharging you, with you negotiating it down, means you’re likely to get the bartering skills.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, then said. “Want to hear a secret?”\r\n\r\nSecrets! Secrets were great!\r\n\r\n“Yeah!”\r\n\r\n“Almost every girl is taken out around System Day or around the time they unlock the system with four coins, and brought to a vendor to buy something cheap. Vendor knows to charge 5, 6, 7 coins when this happens, but they allow themselves to get talked down to 4 or sometimes even less! Vendor makes a bit of extra money, you potentially get the bartering skill, everyone wins!”\r\n\r\nI looked at dad with a mouth that could catch a thousand flies. Oh my gods. It was Santa Claus all over again, a grand societal conspiracy for the betterment of children. I felt a lot better about being ripped off, since I hadn’t really gotten ripped off, and really, it was dad’s money anyways.\r\n\r\nMy mind went to the obvious conclusion.\r\n\r\n“So Lyra’s going to do something similar? Cool! I’ll have to ask what she did!”\r\n\r\nMom walked in at this point with a bag full of shopping, smiled at us, and went to the kitchen to drop off the food. She popped back out a minute later, and sat down at the table with us.\r\n\r\n“Did dad go over the plan with you?”\r\n\r\n“Just that I was going to be learning skills from him!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but remember – the next two days until you unlock the system, you’re MINE.” She said with a mischievous, gleeful look in her eyes.\r\n\r\nI gulped. Getting skills might not be as fun as I thought. Lyra save meeeeee.\r\n'),
('Learning Skills II', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 7, 'Not all skill learning was made equal. I had always thought mom was a harsh taskmistress. No. She had been air and sunshine up until now. I cooked. I baked. I sewed some clothes, fixed a sandal, washed a single shirt in a water bucket, repaired dad’s armor, swept the floor, cleaned out the oven, repaired a window slate (I swear it hadn’t been broken yesterday…), stuffed a pillow, changed the straw, bought more food at market, hauled water from the river, scrubbed the walls (mold was a persistent bastard), made anti-bug herbal pouches, and generally did 1001 things around the house – none of them in a large, sustained way, but enough to get a glimpse, a proper idea of exactly what it took to keep the place running and looking nice.\r\n\r\nLike. I’d done almost all of these things already. A few things I’d been just a hair too young for, until now, but by and large it was a full-system review of every single chore mom could think of, regardless if it was a daily chore, weekly, monthly, or something we only did once a year.\r\n\r\nBy the time the late afternoon rolled around, I was exhausted.\r\n\r\nOf course, that’s when Lyra swung by. Saved by my angel! However, Lyra was crying. This was no good. Elaine to the rescue! I swooped in and gave Lyra a huge hug.\r\n\r\n“You ok?” I softly asked.\r\n\r\nLyra bit her lip, tears welling up.\r\n\r\n“Yes.” She croaked out.\r\n\r\nReally? She didn’t look ok. Well, if she said so…\r\n\r\n“Lyra! What happened!” My mom bustled over, half-shoving me out of the way.\r\n\r\n“Wind weasel.” She croaked out. I looked around her, seeing a pair of deep, nasty gashes on the back of her calves.\r\n\r\nOoooh, that had to hurt.\r\n\r\n“You’re not ok! Why did you say you were ok!” I shouted in outrage to Lyra.\r\n\r\n“Elaine.” My mom’s soft voice was all warning, and I instinctively straightened up.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” I meekly turned to mom, her face all thunderclouds. She sighed.\r\n\r\n“We’ll talk later. Can you please help Lyra onto the patient recliner?” I walked over to Lyra, grabbed her hand, and helped her up onto the patient recliner. Having seen mom do stuff like this before, I told Lyra “Ok, you should roll onto your belly so we can see the backs of your legs.” Lyra, trustingly rolled over.\r\n\r\nMom looked at me thoughtfully, tapping a finger against her lips. She seemed to come to a decision and asked: “Ok Elaine, what do we do next?”\r\n\r\n“Look at it!”\r\n\r\n“Very good! Let’s look at it together.”\r\n\r\nI only had to look down a bit to see Lyra’s calves while mom had to bend over to see. She poked around a bit, then took a step back, giving me a chance to look over every cut, every scrape carefully. It looked like a pair of sickles had hit each calf in an x-shape, but it didn’t look that deep or dangerous. Phewf. I patted Lyra’s shoulder and announced “You’ll be fine! Mom’s going to patch you right up!”\r\n\r\nMom walked back up to me. “Ok Elaine, what do we do now?”\r\n\r\n“Clean the wound!” I spoke with complete self-assurance.\r\n\r\n“Not quite. Being hit like that hurts! If we try to clean it, it’ll just hurt Lyra more! That would be bad. We should handle the pain first before cleaning it out. How can we handle the pain?”\r\n\r\nThat was a real stumper of a question. How did we stop pain? Did we have some sort of tea? I didn’t remember mom ever making tea for someone who came in for healing. Well, not for healing purposes anyways. Was it something we rubbed on them…? I looked at mom and shrugged. “I dunno.”\r\n\r\nFor some reason this made mom smile. “It’s always good to admit when you don’t know something. In this case, I have a skill for it – [Minor Reduce Pain].” She brought her hand over to Lyra, and just like that she was done.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI’d been terribly disappointed the first time I’d seen magic in action. I’d expected to see MAGIC, a great flash of light, a massive mandala of mystic runes! Chanted words, summoned spirits, something.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed. Turns out, a lot of skills were not super flashy, and were pretty anticlimactic. They just did things. Mom didn’t even need to say anything! She could’ve just touched Lyra, and boom! The skill was done. According to what I’d heard and figured out so far.\r\n\r\nMost magic wasn’t anything like the display from the three farmers at the temple earlier. The only visible sign was Lyra’s face becoming less tense, and a deep sigh of contentment coming from her. How could I have known how to remove pain, when removing pain like that was via skill?\r\n\r\nThinking about it, this was a pretty good chance to ask about healing skills!\r\n\r\n“Hey mom, how much mana was that skill? How much power did it take? How much regeneration do you have?” A veritable flood of questions came out of me, the damn bursting as I saw a chance to learn more about magic again. All questions I’d had for years. Everyone had always put me off, saying “wait until System day, I’ll tell you after System day.”\r\n\r\nWell, System day had come and passed, and now I was after ANSWERS!\r\n\r\n“Wait until Lyra’s better before asking! Patients come first.”\r\n\r\nShit Lyra! Of course she came first! Stupid distractable brain.\r\n\r\nI almost patted her legs - they were nearby, after all - then realized it’d probably hurt her. I couldn’t do that! I patted her arm instead.\r\n\r\n“Now what do we do, Elaine?”\r\n\r\n“NOW we clean the wound!” This one I knew. I grabbed a rag near our bucket of water, and dunked it in. Thinking about it, this probably wasn’t very clean – the rag wasn’t sterile, and we had been using the water for other tasks – but I suppose it was good enough.\r\n\r\nHang on. I still knew that. I still knew germ theory! It didn’t get ripped from my mind! Holy shit, was this some sort of oversight? Heart and brain, lungs and guts, stomach and liver, muscles and DNA, viruses and bacteria, joints and tendons, blood and bones – Holy shit I still knew biology! I froze, like a massive [Icy Grip] had just been cast on me, mind whirling. Could I use this? Could I make something out of knowing this? How much could I reveal before someone became suspicious? Could I just claim divine inspiration for everything? After all, knowing all of this WAS technically due to divine intervention. Or not, depending on how you looked at it.\r\n\r\n“Elaine, the rag’s not going to get any wetter the longer you leave it in the bucket.” Mom called with amusement. I jumped about a foot in the air, and walked back to where Lyra was lying down. Act cool, act cool. Nothing to see here. I didn’t just get a Pallos-shattering revelation. Breathe in, breathe out.\r\n\r\nMom could clearly tell something was up with me, but she probably put it down to being nervous for helping her out in her little clinic for the first time, and working on my best friend to boot. I carefully wiped down Lyra’s legs, making sure each stroke was as slow and as gentle as possible. I was easily distractible, until it came to something that really, REALLY needed my focus, and right now, this required every single bit of effort I could muster. No mistakes! No problems! No dirt left behind! I was going to do this RIGHT, so I could keep helping mom out. Lyra needed to get better, there were no other options. How could we run around on adventures, raiding merchants, bothering guards, if she wasn’t able to run around? She would get caught in an instant! Seeing her proud smile on her face as I was doing this, I wanted that approval, I needed that praise. So, dirt! Foul nemesis! Begone!\r\n\r\n“Thanks Elaine.” Lyra softly murmured, and those two words had pride and happiness bouncing around inside me like a pair of happy puppies. A gigantic involuntary smile split my face in half.\r\n\r\nI might have slightly lost track of time as mom coughed gently behind me, and said “Hey, I think her legs are clean enough, we should bandage them up now.” I jumped, face flushing bright red. I just wanted to be thorough, ok?? Covering my embarrassment, I grabbed some thick woolen bandages that we had already prepared, and ran back over to Lyra. I started wrapping, and soon The Mummy re-emerged – as seen from the knees down. I stood back, admiring my work. Mom came over, and ruffled my hair.\r\n\r\n“Good job Elaine! That’s great for your first effort! You might even get the [Bandaging] skill, or EVEN the [First Aid] skill! Wouldn’t that be great!”\r\n\r\nI squirmed happily under the praise. This was a nice feeling. Lyra got up, and without warning, gave me a huge hug.\r\n\r\n“Thank you thank you thank you! It feels so much better now!”\r\n\r\nA warm glow went through me. This healing business was nice!\r\n\r\nMom looked at us amused.\r\n\r\n“You two should go play now. Inside.”\r\n\r\nYeah… we shouldn’t run around too much for now.\r\n\r\nI grabbed my doll, and showed it to Lyra.\r\n\r\n“This is Bella! She’s usually an [Archmage], but today she’s a [Healer]!”\r\n\r\nShe knew all that of course – we had played mages and monsters, lovers and liars, and thousands of other games with our dolls, one of the only toys we had that were truly ours, and not just some communal thing or rocks we had found, or sticks we had shaped.\r\n\r\n“Oooooh,” cooed Lyra “Daphne is a [Divine Priestess], she’s a priestess of the goddess of the moon!”\r\n\r\n“Which one?” That was always the question with Lyra’s doll. Mom had made it for her a few years ago! Two moons, two goddesses, Lyra’s doll could be either one. Lucky twins. Not born twins, friend-twins. Like us!\r\n\r\n“Lunaris!”\r\n\r\nWe happily played together, not even noticing when dinner came out. It was quite eye-opening when mom said “Ok Elaine, I think Lyra needs to go home now.” I happily waved goodbye, with us making promises to meet up tomorrow in the park. Checking with our moms? Nah, no need. Getting in bed was a whirlwind, and as I looked up at the ceiling, I happily kicked my feet.\r\n\r\nLyra was the best friend ever.');

At last!\r\n\r\nThe system lock did a great job at reminding me that while yes, it was my birthday, I still had 19 hours, 11 minutes, and 40 seconds left to go until the actual 8-year-anniversary-to-the-minute of my birth. Bah humbug. It was my birthday already! Unlock! Unloooooock! I’d grab and shake the System if only I could get a grip on it. Getting up carefully to avoid waking up mom and dad – he was shifting back over to day-duty – I wandered around the house getting ready for the morning.\r\n\r\nA brief whirlwind of chores in the morning, then lunch! Mom had cooked, shooing me out of the kitchen – a rarity when she was trying to get me every skill possible. Dad was around as well, and the three of us sat down together for a delicious lunch. Once it was over, there was a surprise for me!\r\n\r\n“Happy Birthday Elaine” mom said. “Hair up.”\r\n\r\nI dutifully grabbed the back of my hair and lifted it up, as mom put a pendant around my neck. It was made of iron, and it was the same diamond-shape that I had seen in the temple.\r\n\r\n“For bringing good luck. For protection. My awakening gift to you. I hope it’ll keep you safe, the same way it kept me safe, the same way it kept your grandmother safe.” Mom smiled at me.\r\n\r\nI teared up at the gift. I had no words. I got up and gave mom a big, crushing hug. As crushing as an 8-year-old can get anyways – blast my low strength stat, it didn’t adequately let me show how much it meant to me.\r\n\r\n“Elaine,” my dad said, taking out a modest knife and sheath, “this is also for you. For warding off bad luck. For safety. This is not a toy, and you can start wearing it once we’ve finished lessons with it together. But treat it well, and it’ll be with you the rest of your life.”\r\n\r\nMom had a quick flash of annoyance go over her face, I solemnly took the knife out of the sheath. It was four inches of Noric steel, with a beautiful pommel capped with a small clear crystal.\r\n\r\n“The crystal is an Arcanite. Your mom and I both know how much you dream of being a mage, and even if you don’t go down that path, the Arcanite in the handle will help you with your mana reserves. Treat it well.”\r\n\r\nOh my gods. Arcanite. Noric Steel. I didn’t want to imagine how much this knife cost. I gave dad a less-fierce hug, trying to show my self-control and maturity, that I was worthy of the gift he had gotten me. There would be no wild flailing on mango skin with this knife. There would be no attempts to cut my hair either. I winced at the memory of the spanking I had gotten with mom’s spoon for trying that. This knife wasn’t a toy.\r\n\r\n“Now,” mom said, clapping her hands together. “Something a bit more fun!” mom exclaimed, pulling out a tunic.\r\n\r\nHang on, that wasn’t a beige bamboo tunic. That was a beautiful bamboo tunic, with a bright green trim on the edges. It was beautiful. I was in love.\r\n\r\n“Are… are you sure mom?” I looked up inquisitively. I wanted this tunic. I needed this tunic. But I couldn’t believe it was being given to me. I got dirty. I wiped greasy fingers on my shirt. I spilt mango juice all over myself. In short, I was a filthy, grubby, rapidly growing kid that had no business being in a dyed shirt, let alone a beauty like this one.\r\n\r\nMom seemed to sense my thoughts, and helped me out. “Well, this isn’t to wear every day. And as you get older, you’ll be able to take the trims and move them into a bigger shirt. It’s my devious master plan to get you enthusiastic about sewing.”\r\n\r\nMaster plan success. While I had never been reluctant to sew things, I had never really been that passionate about it. Now [Sewing] was near the top of my “must-have” list of skills.\r\n\r\nI was overwhelmed and happy at how much thought and care went into the gifts my parents got me for my birthday. I quietly swore to myself that I’d get them something extra-nice this year. Money was a problem though – nobody was going to pay an eight-year-old anything. If anything, I would have to be the one paying to learn things. Maybe I could get some lessons from the light-fingered kids at the market. Afterall, it was for a good cause.\r\n\r\nI changed into my brilliant new tunic, giving myself a happy whirl in it. Happy greens! I was entering the big leagues!\r\n\r\nAfter lunch and the birthday presents, blessedly, mom had mercy on me! No chores! Birthday treat! Off to the park we went! Trees and flowers and grass, all in the middle of town! We made it to the park, and mom let me run around while she went over to some benches with some other parents keeping a benevolent eye on all of us. I found Lyra at our usual spot, working on her knucklebones game.\r\n\r\n“Lyra!” “Elaine!” One great big fierce hug later, “How are your legs? Are they ok?” I looked down, noticing my mummy impression was still there.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, they feel fine! You’re amazing! That tunic is so nice!”\r\n\r\n“Thank you! I just got it as a birthday present!” I felt a little bad wearing the tunic here. Lyra’s clothes were always ratty.\r\n\r\nLyra and I hadn’t gotten each other presents. It just wasn’t a thing here.\r\n\r\n“When are you unlocking? I unlock tonight! I can\'t wait!\"\r\n\r\n13 hours, 18 minutes, and 5 seconds left. I was counting down every moment.\r\n\r\n“Wellll…” Lyra responded, mischief in her eyes. “I UNLOCKED THIS MORNING!”\r\n\r\n“OHMYGOD!” with much grabbing of hands and jumping up and down. “What class did you get? What level did you get? What skills?? Tell me everything!”\r\n\r\nAfter much excitement, happy noises, and rapid-fire-too-excited-to-follow, I finally got a complete picture. Lyra had gotten the [Child of Remus] class with a Wood alignment, a fairly standard one for people in the Republic of Remus. She had gone right up to level 7, which I had no benchmark for how impressive it was. As a result, she was sitting on 14 free stat points to allocate, and she hadn’t done any allocation yet. “Because mom and dad need to chat and figure out where I’m putting them. And they want to see what class I unlock at level 8.”\r\n\r\nIt made sense that Lyra’s parents would want to do a bit of min-maxing on her skills and abilities, but that made me fearful myself. Would mom and dad insist that I allocate my points a certain way? Would I be given any leeway? The fact that we hadn’t had the conversation yet made me nervous, and they had been acting incredibly nice recently. Was I being softened up for a terrible blow to come? Ah well, problem for future me. Today was for fun!\r\n\r\nI didn’t usually play with anyone else, but Lyra did! I tried out knucklebones, borrowing Lyra’s set and failing miserably. Higher dexterity was better for this game, and I glanced suspiciously at Lyra, wondering if she had secretly allocated a point or two into it. It could also be experience, since I wasn’t the biggest fan of the game while Lyra loved it. I was getting bored when two boys – Quintus and Pentus - came over with a ball, and asked Lyra:\r\n\r\n“Hey, do you two want to play?” Quintus inquired.\r\n\r\nI didn’t like playing with others. Usually we played Formorians vs Soldiers or Rangers vs Bandits, and I was ALWAYS a Formorian or a bandit, it wasn’t fair. Usually Lyra would help me out, but Formorians always lost. It was the rules. I hated getting hit with sticks.\r\n\r\nAt least when I was a bandit I’d get my own stick to swing at people.\r\n\r\nLyra did like playing, even as a Formorian. It was the source of most of her black eyes, but she usually gave TWICE as many as she got! She was amazing like that. She gave me puppy eyes. It was our birthday I suppose.\r\n\r\n“Fine, fine. Let’s go!”\r\n\r\nThe game looked and sounded suspiciously like volleyball. How old was that game? A few more kids rounded up for an opposing team, and off we went!\r\n\r\nMe, Lyra, Quintus, and Pentus were all on the same team, against a girl and three other boys. We were all about the same age, but I didn’t recognize any of them. I stood in the back as the girl on the other team inexpertly served the ball up. A slow, lazy move over, as Quintus, Pentus, and Lyra all moved to intercept. The concept of standing apart for the good of the team wasn’t quite a concept most kids had gotten yet – it was more fun to chase after the ball and hit it after all. I couldn’t blame them – I would be there if I wasn’t trying to keep my tunic nice and clean.\r\n\r\nPOP! Ball went up, but instead of going back over the three-foot-tall net, it headed up and back towards me. The benefits of standing away. I popped the ball back over, a long, lazy shot, and the four kids on the other side all scrambled for it. Up high it went on their side, staying on their side, when one of the boys dove to hit it again. The dive was good! He hit it, up it went! … and promptly landed back on their side.\r\n\r\nLyra and I stifled giggles, while the diver brushed himself off. His mom was going to be pissed, but better him than me! One point to us! The winning wasn’t nearly as important as the fun, and I had dramatically under-estimated just how fun this was. I had been missing out! Kids played terribly, coordinated terribly, and didn’t do much in the way of planning to win (although they were trying), but in spite of all of that, I found myself having a blast with Lyra.\r\n\r\nThe game went back and forth, points being traded equally. 4-3. 6-7. 10-10. I was being mindful of my nice new tunic, and I was just trying to have fun, so I wasn’t putting in my best effort. At the same time, since I wasn’t constantly running straight to the ball, I was able to contribute quite a bit more. Lyra winced and grimaced at one point, rubbing her legs. She eventually started to mimic me, keeping her feet planted unmovingly in one spot. Her mummy bandages now looked the proper dusty brown of a mummy, and that made me giggle.\r\n\r\nIt couldn’t last forever, nothing does. The shadows were starting to get a bit longer as we heard the inevitable “Elaine!” “Lyra!” “Time to go home! Do you want to go home now, or do one more round then go home?” The score was tied, 12-12. While I wasn’t hellbent on winning, it would be nice. Plus, the longer we stayed, the better!\r\n\r\n“One more one more!” was the near unanimous chorus from the eight of us. Their parents were also circling, but at that they started saying their goodbyes to each other. Adults. Always needing to take the long way with things.\r\n\r\nLyra served. The ball went up and over, and another one of the nameless boys on their side bounced it back. They had learned from us, and were no longer all desperately sprinting after the ball. I felt a little proud of that, being able to teach and show kids how to do things. Maybe I’d take a [Teacher] class? The ball was going a bit far – it’d be out of bounds if that sort of thing mattered to kids – but Quintus ran after it anyway, hitting it back towards us. Lyra was firmly standing her ground, and Pentus had been running after the ball anyways, hitting it back up and over, directly to the nameless girl. The rest of their team clustered around her anyways. She effortlessly hit it back (She was so good, did she already have a [Volleyball Player] class or something!?), and it went straight to Lyra. She reached out awkwardly, and hit it towards me.\r\n\r\nI watched it slowly spiral up and to the side lazily. Everyone else was on the other side of the field. I ran for it, trying to get it. I could dive for it. I’d get it, they were out of position on the other side of the net. We’d win, glory and fame for us forever. It’d ruin my shirt.\r\n\r\nI took a deep breath, steeled myself, extended my arms, and –\r\n\r\nMissed the ball, watching it drop just in front of my arms. Ah well, such is life.\r\n\r\nWhoops and cheers from the other team, groaning and disappointed noises from our team. I shrugged. It\'s how things went sometimes. Time to go ho-WHAM.\r\n\r\nI suddenly felt two hands on me violently moving me out of the way, head snapping back as I gasped in shock.\r\n\r\nI barely managed to catch myself, whirling around in anger. Who – Lyra!? Why would she – I spotted a large glob of mud on her back. Oh. OH. Lyra got up, wincing as she got up.\r\n\r\n“Are you ok?” we asked at the same time, ignoring our parents descending on us. “Yeah” we both said at the same time. Twins!\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask what happened, but from the yelling noises Pentus’s parent was making, I was able to piece it together.\r\n\r\nPentus had seen that I probably could’ve dived for the ball, and chose not to. Upon us losing the point, and with us going home, the match, he did what every reasonable (NOT!) kid would do – throw mud at me. At my nice new tunic. Lyra, seeing this, pushed me out of the way and took the mud pie for me.\r\n\r\nBest. Friend. Ever.\r\n\r\nThose JERKS though! I was going to murder them! Jackasses! Dino-turds!\r\n\r\nI started to stomp over, when Lyra grabbed my sleeve. I stopped and cocked my head at her, looking at her crazy grin. “What is it?”\r\n\r\n“I leveled up from that.” She responded, with a grin that would split her face in half if it got any bigger.\r\n\r\n“YAAAAAAAY!” I cried, doing some quick math.\r\n\r\n“Wait, that makes you level 8! You get to pick a class now!” jumping up and down with excitement. “What are your options? What does it look like? What are you going to pick? Are you going to be a [Divine Priestess] like Daphne?”\r\n\r\nLyra looked overwhelmed and as pleased as a cat with cream. “Silly Elaine!” she drew herself up, proud that she could teach me something. “You can’t just become a [Divine Priestess]. You’d have to pick something else that turns into a [Divine Priestess], like a uh… uhhh…. [Apprentice Divine Priestess]!” Stumbling in the middle, Lyra managed to stick the landing anyways. It was good information, although why my parents had never told me anything about classes evolving like that, and needing to go down a path, I didn’t know. Maybe it had something to do with the temple enforcing System Day being people’s first contact? An unimportant mystery, but maybe I needed to ask them for more information.\r\n\r\n“Hey Lyra,”\r\n\r\n“Yeah?”\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me about the gods? I got this pendant for my birthday, I have seen the symbol in the temple, but I dunno what it means.” I asked, fishing the pendant out from under my tunic. I had never been particularly religious, in spite of my meeting with Papilion. Probably should’ve asked these questions ages ago.\r\n\r\nOk. Fine. I’ll confess. I’d gotten the lectures ages ago, but I’d entirely tuned them out, and I’d pretended to know ever since, just nodding along whenever the gods were mentioned. I’d puzzled out a few things from context, but…\r\n\r\nWell, I was ready to swallow my pride and get all the information. At last.\r\n\r\n“Sure! Ok, ok, first there were five gods, the big gods! They made Pallos and everything on it!” Lyra grabbed the pendant, and started pointing. “On this side is life - Aion, on that side is death - Thanatos”, pointing to the two side corners. “On the top is Order - Seira, on the bottom is Chaos - Xaoc. And Change – Papilion - is in the middle! He keeps everything moving and balanced.”\r\n\r\nAh, Change, that bastard shows up again. Although from the sound of it, it was a bigwig that decided to interfere with me dying. I shrugged. It was done and over. No way I could get revenge on a god, let alone a Major God with capitals.\r\n\r\n“Also, as you pray to the gods, you send mana to them. However, they can grant prayers if you’ve prayed enough! So you should pick one god, and only worship that god.”\r\n\r\nThat was interesting. I figured if I was going to try that, I’d pray to Papilion. I had something of a working relationship with him already, and major god? God of change? Seemed pretty flexible.\r\n\r\nLyra scratched the back of her legs again through the bandages.\r\n\r\n\"You sure you\'re ok?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yup! Completely fine!\" She responded. I eyed her. I suspected she was lying again, like she’d lied to me earlier. Had… had she been doing that more often than just that one time, and I’d never noticed? Was I a bad friend? Or was I a good friend for believing her, and not pushing her? It wasn\'t my place to force her to tell me, yet. I wish she would though.\r\n\r\nOur parents came to pick us up, but I owed Lyra. “Hey mom, do you have a spare tunic for Lyra? I want to wash hers. It’s the least I could do.” Mom smiled, and with a spare tunic pulled out of nowhere, a quick change, and I suddenly had signed myself up for more laundry. It was for Lyra though, and that made me hum a happy tune on the way back home.\r\n\r\nDinner was over in a flash, and with 7 hours, 7 minutes, and 53 seconds to go, I couldn’t wait.\r\n\r\n“Mom, can I pleaseeeee stay up? Pretty please?”\r\n\r\nMom and dad shared an amused look. I didn’t see what was so funny – this was serious! I wanted to watch my System unlock! Sure, it would be the middle of the night, but SYSTEM! MAGIC!\r\n\r\n“Sure, but why don’t we get you a pillow and a blanket so you’re comfortable while you wait? And why don’t you change out of your nice tunic?”\r\n\r\nConcessions. I narrowed my eyes. Fine, I could deal with that. We put the pillow on the high part of the recliner I was on, and I wrapped the absolutely massive blanket many, many times around me. [High Empress] Elaine was here! Bow before me! I settled in, and realized a few problems.\r\n\r\nOne – it was another 6 hours, 58 minutes, and 30 seconds to go.\r\n\r\nTwo – I had nothing to do but be excited.\r\n\r\nThree – I needed to pee.\r\n\r\nUnraveled myself, sprinted outside to the communal restroom (Thankfully with Inscriptions – the only ones I had ever seen), did my business, sprinted back. Re-ensconced, heart racing at a million miles an hour. 6 hours, 54 minutes, 45 seconds to go.\r\n\r\n44 seconds to go.\r\n\r\n43 seconds to go.\r\n\r\n42 seconds to go.\r\n\r\nThe blankets were warm and cozy, and the pillow was so soft and inviting. There was no real reason to stay upright the whole time now, was there?\r\n\r\nI started at the timer slowly counting down. 5 hours, 16 minutes, 32 seconds to go. I yawned. Blinked. 2 hours, 29 minutes, 5 seconds. Blinked, and -');

('Life’s Little Problems', 'Mother of Learning', 2, 'Although the academy loved saying they were an elite institution thanks to the excellent quality of its teaching staff, the truth was that the main reason for their supremacy was their library. Through contributions of its alumni, generous budget allocations by a number of former headmasters, quirks of local criminal law, and sheer historical accident, the academy had built a library without equal. You could find anything you wanted, regardless of whether the topic was magical or not – there was a whole section reserved for steamy romance novels, for instance. The library was so massive it had actually expanded into the tunnels beneath the city. Many of the lower levels were only accessible to guild mages, so it was only now that Zorian was allowed to browse their contents. Fortunately, the library was open during the weekend, so the very first thing Zorian did when he woke up was descend into these depths to see what he\'d been missing these past two years and maybe fill out his spellbook a bit.\r\n\r\nHe was pleasantly surprised at the sheer number of spells and training manuals available to a first circle mage. There were more books and spells than he could master in a lifetime. Most of the spells were either highly situational or minor variations of each other, so he didn’t feel the need to obsessively learn all of them, but he could already see this place would keep him busy all year round. A lot of them looked surprisingly easy and harmless, and he couldn’t help but wonder why they were kept on the restricted level instead of being available to everyone. He could have used these during his second year.\r\n\r\nHe was right in the middle of trying to find the rain barrier the academy incorporated into its ward scheme when he realized he had skipped breakfast and was getting awfully hungry, and that it was past noon. Reluctantly, he checked out a couple of books to pore over in depth in the safety of his room and went to get something to eat.\r\n\r\nThere was no kitchen in his room, sadly, but the academy had a pretty good cafeteria available to students – the food they offered was cheap yet surprisingly edible. Still, it was something of a poor man’s option, and most of the richer kids ate in one of the many restaurants in the vicinity of the academy. That’s why Zorian was a bit shocked when he entered the cafeteria and realized that changes to the academy weren’t only in exterior appearances – the cafeteria was positively sparkling, and all the tables and chairs were brand new. It was weird to see the place so… clean.\r\n\r\nShaking his head, he quickly loaded a couple of plates on his tray, idly noting the cooks were a lot less stingy with the meat and other expensive parts of the dish all of a sudden, and then started scanning the eating students for familiar faces. Clearly something was happening here, and he hated being left outside the loop.\r\n\r\n“Zorian! Over here!”\r\n\r\nHow fortunate. Zorian immediately set off towards the chubby boy gesturing for him to come over. Zorian had learned over the years that his exuberant classmate was firmly plugged into the academy gossip network, and knew pretty much everything and everyone. If anyone would know what was going on, it would be Benisek.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Ben,” Zorian said. “I’m surprised to see you in Cyoria so soon. Don’t you usually come with the last train?”\r\n\r\n“I should be asking you that!” Benisek half-shouted. Zorian never understood why the boy had to be so loud all the time. “I came here so early but you’re already here!”\r\n\r\n“You came back two days before classes start, Ben,” Zorian said, resisting the urge to roll his eyes at him. Only Benisek would think that coming a couple of days early is some great feat worth mentioning. “That’s not all that early. And I just got back yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“So did I,” Benisek said. “Damn. If you had contacted me, we could have arranged to travel together or something. You must have been bored out of your mind here, all alone for a whole day.”\r\n\r\n“Something like that,” agreed Zorian, smiling politely.\r\n\r\n“So are you excited?” Benisek asked, suddenly changing the topic.\r\n\r\n“About what?” Zorian asked. Funny, hadn’t Kirielle asked him the exact same question?\r\n\r\n“The start of a new year! We’re third years now, that’s when the real fun starts.”\r\n\r\nZorian blinked. To his knowledge, Benisek was one of those people who weren’t terribly concerned about their success in the arcane arts. He already had a guaranteed post in his family business, and was here simply to obtain the prestige of being a licensed mage. Zorian had half expected him to drop out immediately following certification, yet here he was, just as excited as Zorian to finally start delving into the real mysteries of magic. Now he felt pretty bad about writing him off so quickly. He really shouldn’t be so presumptuous…\r\n\r\n“Oh, that. Of course I’m excited. Though I must admit I never knew you actually cared about your education.”\r\n\r\n“What are you talking about?” asked Benisek, eying him suspiciously. “The girls, man, I’m talking about the girls. The younger ones love upperclassmen like us! The new batch of first years will be all over us.”\r\n\r\nZorian groaned. He should have known.\r\n\r\n“Anyway,” said Zorian, recovering quickly, “since I know you’re always gossiping around-“\r\n\r\n“Informing myself about the current state of things,” Benisek cut in, his voice assuming a mock-lecturing quality.\r\n\r\n“Right. What’s with the academy being all sparkly and clean all of a sudden?”\r\n\r\nBenisek blinked. “You didn’t know? Oh man, people have been talking about this for months! Just which rock do you live under, Zorian?”\r\n\r\n“Cirin is a glorified village in the middle of nowhere… as you very well know,” Zorian said. “Now spill.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the summer festival,” Benisek said. “The whole city is getting ready for it, not just the academy.”\r\n\r\n“But there’s a summer festival every year,” Zorian said, confused.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, but this year is special.”\r\n\r\n“Special?” Zorian asked. “How?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, some astrological bullshit,” Benisek whined, waving his hand dismissively. “Why does it matter? It’s an excuse to have an even bigger party than usual. Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth, I say.”\r\n\r\n“Astro-“ began Zorian with a quirked eyebrow when something occurred to him. “Wait, you mean planetary alignment?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, that,” Benisek agreed. “What’s that anyway?”\r\n\r\n“Do you have a couple of hours?”\r\n\r\n“On second thought, I don’t want to know,” Benisek quickly backpedaled, chuckling nervously.\r\n\r\nZorian snorted. So easy to scare. The truth was that Zorian knew very little about planar alignments, and probably couldn’t speak about them longer than 30 seconds. It was a pretty obscure topic. Zorian strongly suspected that Benisek was right, and that it was being used simply as an excuse to have a bigger party.\r\n\r\n“So what did you do over the summer?” Benisek asked.\r\n\r\nZorian groaned. “Ben, you sound like my elementary school literature teacher. ‘Now, children, for your homework you will write a short essay about what you did during the summer holidays.’”\r\n\r\n“I’m just being polite,” Benisek said defensively. “No need to snap at me because you wasted your summer away.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, and you spent it productively?” Zorian challenged.\r\n\r\n“Well, not voluntarily,” Benisek admitted sheepishly. “Father decided it was time I start learning the family craft, so I spent all summer helping him and acting as his assistant.”\r\n\r\n“Oh.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Benisek agreed, clacking his tongue. “He also made me choose estate management as one of my electives. I hear it’s a really tough class too.”\r\n\r\n“Hm. Can’t say my summer was particularly stressful. I spent most of my time reading fiction and avoiding my family,” admitted Zorian. “Mother tried to dump my little sister on me this year, but I managed to talk her out of it.”\r\n\r\n“I feel for you,” Benisek said with a shudder. “I’ve got two younger sisters and I think I’d die if they came to live with me here. They’re both utter nightmares! Anyway, what did you take for your electives?”\r\n\r\n“Engineering, Mineral Alchemy, and Advanced Mathematics.”\r\n\r\n“Eh!?” Benisek blanched. “Man, you’re really taking this seriously, aren’t you? I guess you’re gunning for a spot in one of the spell forges, huh?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Zorian said.\r\n\r\n“Why?” Benisek asked incredulously. “Designing magic items… that’s a tough, demanding job. Surely your parents could find you a spot in their business?”\r\n\r\nZorian gave him a strained smile. Yes, no doubt his parents already had a spot all planned out for him.\r\n\r\n“I’d rather starve out in the streets,” Zorian told him honestly.\r\n\r\nBenisek raised an eyebrow at him, but then simply shook his head sadly. “I think you’re crazy, personally. Who did you choose as your mentor?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t get to choose,” Zorian scoffed. “There was only one left by the time it was my turn to do so. I’m mentored under Xvim.”\r\n\r\nBenisek actually dropped his spoon at this, staring at him in shock. “Xvim!? But that guy’s a nightmare!”\r\n\r\n“I know,” Zorian said, releasing a long-suffering sigh.\r\n\r\n“God, I’d probably transfer if I got assigned to that asshole,” Benisek said. “You’re a lot braver a man than I, that’s for sure.”\r\n\r\n“So who did you choose?” Zorian asked curiously.\r\n\r\n“Carabiera Aope,” Benisek said, immediately brightening.\r\n\r\n“Please don’t tell me you chose your mentor based on appearance?” begged Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Well, not just based on appearance,” Benisek said defensively. “They say she’s pretty tolerant…”\r\n\r\n“You don’t want to do any extra work,” Zorian surmised.\r\n\r\n“This whole thing is like a vacation to me,” Benisek admitted sheepishly. “I get to postpone employment for two years and have some fun in the meantime. You’re only young once, you know?”\r\n\r\nZorian shrugged. Personally he found learning about magic and gathering knowledge in general to be fun all by itself, but he knew all too well that very few people shared this opinion with him.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” Zorian said noncommittally. “So is there anything else that everyone knows that I should be familiar with?”\r\n\r\nHe spent another hour or so conversing with Benisek, touching upon a variety of topics. It was particularly interesting to hear which of their classmates would be joining them this year and which ones wouldn’t. Zorian had thought the certification exam was a bit on the easy side, but apparently he was mistaken, since roughly a quarter of their classmates would not be joining them. He did notice that most of the failed students were civilian-born ones, but this wasn’t terribly unusual – mage-born students had parental support when learning magic, and a reputation to live up to. He was pleasantly surprised that one particular asshole wouldn’t be joining them this year – apparently Veyers Boranova lost his temper on his disciplinary hearing and got himself expelled from the academy. He wouldn’t be missed. Honestly, that boy was a menace and it was a disgrace they hadn’t expelled him sooner. Fortunately, it seemed there were some things that just couldn’t be overlooked, even if you were an heir of Noble House Boranova.\r\n\r\nHe left when Benisek started discussing pros and cons of various girls in their class, not willing to get dragged into such a discussion, and went back to his room to get some reading done. He hadn’t even opened the first book properly when he was interrupted by a knock on the door. Very few people cared to track him down to his room, so he actually had a pretty good idea of who it was before he even opened the door.\r\n\r\n“Hi, Roach!”\r\n\r\nZorian stared at the grinning girl in front of him, contemplating whether to take offense at the insulting nickname before shooing her inside. In the past, while he was still crushing on her, the nickname had kind of hurt… now it was just slightly annoying. Taiven promptly ran inside and jumped on his bed like a little kid. Really, what had he ever seen in her? Beside a beautiful older girl who was fairly nice to him and had a propensity to wear form-fitting clothes, that is.\r\n\r\n“I thought you graduated,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I did,” she answered, taking one of the spellbooks he borrowed from the library into her lap to leaf through it. Seeing how she had already taken over his bed, he sat down on the chair in front of his work desk. “But you know how it goes – there’s always too many young mages, never enough masters willing to take them under their wing. I’m working as a class assistant for Nirthak. Hey, if you took nonmagical combat you’re going to see me all the time!”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, right,” Zorian snorted. “Nirthak blacklisted me in advance, just in case I get any ideas.”\r\n\r\n“Really!?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Not that I would ever sign up for a class like that anyway,” Zorian said. Except maybe to watch Taiven all sweaty and puffed up in that tight outfit she always wore whenever she trained.\r\n\r\n“Pity,” she said, seemingly engrossed in his book. “You really should put on some muscle one of these days. Girls like boys who exercise.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what girls like,” Zorian snapped crankily. She was starting to sound like his mother. “Why are you here anyway?”\r\n\r\n“Oh calm down, it was just a thought,” she said with a dramatic sigh. “Boys and their fragile little egos.”\r\n\r\n“Taiven, I like you, but you’re really treading on thin ice here,” Zorian warned.\r\n\r\n“I came here to ask if you would join me and a couple of others on a job tomorrow,” she said, throwing the book aside and finally getting to the point of her visit.\r\n\r\n“A job?” Zorian asked suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Well, more like a mission. You know those job postings people tack onto the big board inside the administrative building?”\r\n\r\nZorian nodded. Whenever a mage in the city wanted something done for cheap, he posted a ‘job offer’ there for interested students. The payout was generally miserable, but students had to collect ‘points’ by doing these, so everyone had to do a number of them. Most people didn’t start doing these before their fourth year, unless they really needed the money, and Zorian fully intended to follow this tradition.\r\n\r\n“There is a pretty nice one there,” Taiven said. “It’s actually just a simple find and retrieve in the tunnels below the city that-“\r\n\r\n“A sewer run!?” asked Zorian incredulously, cutting her off. “You want me to go on a sewer run?”\r\n\r\n“It’s good experience!” Taiven protested.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Zorian, crossing his arms. “No way.”\r\n\r\n“Oh come on, Roach, I’m begging you!” Taiven whined. “We can’t apply until we find a fourth member of the team! Would it kill you to make this tiny sacrifice for your old friend?”\r\n\r\n“It very well might!” Zorian said.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have three other people to protect you!” she assured. “We’ve been there hundreds of times and nothing really dangerous ever happens down there – the rumors are mostly exaggerated.”\r\n\r\nZorian snorted and looked away. Even if they really did keep him safe, it was still a trek through smelly, disease-ridden tunnels with three people he didn’t really know, and who probably resented having to bring him along for the sake of a formality.\r\n\r\nBesides, he still hadn’t forgiven her for that fake date she invited him on. She may not have known he was crushing on her at the time, but it was still a pretty insensitive thing she did that evening.\r\n\r\nAlso, he might feel a little more inclined to help if she stopped calling him ‘Roach’. It was not nearly as cute as she thought it was.\r\n\r\n“Okay, how about a bet?” she tried.\r\n\r\n“No,” Zorian promptly refused.\r\n\r\nShe let out an affronted cry. “You didn’t even hear me out!”\r\n\r\n“You want to fight,” Zorian said. “You always want to fight.”\r\n\r\n“So?” she pouted. “You chickening out? You’re admitting you’d lose to a girl?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely,” Zorian deadpanned. Both of Taiven’s parents were martial arts practitioners, and they had taught her how to fight since she could walk. Zorian wouldn’t last five seconds against her in hand-to-hand combat.\r\n\r\nHell, he doubted anyone in school would do much better.\r\n\r\nTaiven waved her hands in the air in a frustrated gesture and promptly collapsed on his bed, and for a moment Zorian actually thought she was accepting defeat. Then she sat up and folded her legs under her until she was sitting in a lotus position. The smile on her face was giving Zorian a bad feeling.\r\n\r\n“So,” she began cheerfully. “How have you been?”\r\n\r\nZorian sighed. This was not how he intended to spend his weekend.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Zorian was well settled into his new room and it was Monday morning. Rising early was pure torture after he had gotten into the habit of sleeping in, but he managed. He had many flaws, but a lack of self-discipline wasn’t one of them.\r\n\r\nHe had managed to fend off Taiven after three hours of verbal wrangling, though he was in no mood for anything after that and put off reading for another day after her visit. In the end he spent the entire weekend lazing around, actually somewhat impatient for the classes to start.\r\n\r\nThe first class of the day was Essential Invocations, and Zorian wasn’t quite sure what it was supposed to teach. Most of the other classes on his schedule had a clear subject of study visible from the very name of the subject, but ‘invocation’ was a general term. Invocations were what most people thought about when someone said ‘magic’ – a few arcane words and strange gestures and poof! Magic effect. It was actually more involved than that – a lot more involved – but that was the visible part, so that’s what people focused on. Clearly the academy felt the class was important, because they had a period scheduled for it every day of the week.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the classroom, he noticed a familiar person standing in front of the door with a clipboard in her hands. This, at least, was a familiar sight. Akoja Stroze had been the class representative for his group since their first year, and she took her position very seriously. She gave him a harsh look when she noticed him, and Zorian wondered what he had done to annoy her now.\r\n\r\n“You’re late,” she stated when he got close enough.\r\n\r\nZorian raised an eyebrow at this. “The class doesn’t start for at least 10 more minutes. How can I be late?”\r\n\r\n“Students are supposed to be in the classroom and ready for class 15 minutes before the class starts,” she stated.\r\n\r\nZorian rolled his eyes. This was ridiculous, even for Akoja. “Am I the last person to arrive?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she conceded after a short silence.\r\n\r\nZorian walked past her and entered the classroom.\r\n\r\nYou could always tell when you walked into a gathering of mages – their appearance and fashion sense gave them away unerringly, especially in Cyoria where mages from all over the world sent their children. Many of his classmates came from established magical families, if not outright Houses, and many mage lineages produced children with noticeable peculiarities, either because of bloodlines passed down from parents or because of secret enhancement rituals they subjected themselves to… things like having green hair, or always giving birth to soul-bonded twins, or having tattoo-like markings on their cheeks and forehead. And these were real examples exhibited by his classmates.\r\n\r\nShaking his head to clear his thoughts, he went towards the front of the classroom, throwing polite greetings to those few classmates he knew a little better than the rest. No one really tried to talk to him – though there was no bad blood between him and anyone in the class, he was not particularly close to any of them either.\r\n\r\nHe was just about to sit down when frantic hissing interrupted him. He glanced to his left, watching his classmate whisper soothingly to the orange-red lizard in his lap. The animal was staring at him intently with its bright yellow eyes, nervously tasting the air with its tongue, but didn’t hiss again when Zorian carefully lowered himself into the chair.\r\n\r\n“Sorry about that,” the boy said. “He’s still a little uneasy around strangers.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry about it,” Zorian said, waving the apology away. He didn’t know Briam all that well, but he did know his family bred fire drakes for a living, so it wasn’t that unusual for him to have one. “I see your family has given you a fire drake of your own. Familiar?”\r\n\r\nBriam nodded happily, scratching the lizard’s head absent-mindedly and causing the creature to close its eyes in contentment. “I bonded with him over the summer holidays,” he said. “Familiar bond is a little strange at first, but I think I’m getting the hang of it. At least I’ve managed to talk him out of breathing fire at people without permission, else I would have to put a fire-suppressant collar on him, and he hates that thing.”\r\n\r\n“The school won’t bother you about bringing it to class?” Zorian asked curiously.\r\n\r\n“Him,” Briam corrected. “And no, they won’t. You can bring a familiar to class if you’ve reported them to the academy and can get them to behave. And, of course, as long as they’re reasonably sized.”\r\n\r\n“I hear fire drakes can get pretty big,” Zorian remarked speculatively.\r\n\r\n“They do,” Briam agreed. “That’s why I wasn’t allowed to have one till now. In a few years he’ll get way too big to follow me into the classroom, but by that time I’ll already be finished with my education and back at the ranch.”\r\n\r\nSatisfied the creature wouldn’t try to take a bite out of him during class, Zorian let his attention wander elsewhere. He mostly spent his time studying the girls as covertly as possible. He blamed Benisek for this, since he usually wasn’t in the habit of ogling his classmates. No matter how cute some of them were…\r\n\r\n“Hot, isn’t she?”\r\n\r\nZorian jumped in surprise at the voice behind him and cursed himself for being caught so unawares.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said quickly, turning as calmly as possible in his seat to face Zach. The cheery, smiling face of his classmate told him he wasn’t fooling anyone.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be so flustered,” Zach told him happily. “I don’t think there’s a single boy in class who doesn’t occasionally daydream about our resident red-headed goddess.”\r\n\r\nZorian snorted. Actually, he wasn’t looking at Raynie at all, but at the girl she was talking to. Not that he was going to correct Zach about that. Or anything, really – Zorian had mixed feelings about Zach. On the one hand the raven-haired boy was charming, confident, handsome, and popular – and thus reminded him uncomfortably of his brothers – but on the other hand he was never mean or inconsiderate to Zorian, and would often chat with him when everyone else was content to ignore him. As a result, Zorian was never quite sure how to act around him.\r\n\r\nBesides, Zorian never discussed his tastes in women with other boys. The academy rumor mill breathed rumors about who liked who, and Zorian knew all too well how even relatively innocuous rumors could make your life miserable for years to come.\r\n\r\n“From your wistful tone, I’m guessing she’s still immune to your charm,” Zorian said, trying to shift the focus of the conversation away from him.\r\n\r\n“She’s tricky,” Zach agreed. “But I’ve got all the time in the world.”\r\n\r\nZorian raised an eyebrow at that, not sure what the other boy was implying. All the time in the world?\r\n\r\nThankfully, he was saved from further conversation when the door noisily opened and the teacher entered the classroom. Zorian was honestly surprised to see Ilsa walk into class with the huge green book that all teachers carried, though he really shouldn’t have been – he already knew Ilsa was a teacher at the academy, so there was nothing unusual about her teaching this class. She gave him a smile before setting the book down on her desk and clapping her hands together to silence those students who were too engrossed in their own conversations to notice the teacher in the room.\r\n\r\n“Settle down everyone, the class has started,” Ilsa said, accepting the list of present students from Akoja, who remained standing beside Ilsa at attention, like a soldier in front of a superior officer.\r\n\r\n“Welcome, students, to your first class of the new school year. I am Ilsa Zileti and I will be your teacher for this class. You are third year students now, meaning you have passed your certification and joined us in our… illustrious magi community. You have proven yourself to be intelligent, driven, and capable of bending mana – the lifeblood of magic – to your will. But your journey is just beginning. As all of you have noticed, and many of you have complained about, you have only been taught a handful of spells so far, and all of them are mere cantrips. You’ll be pleased to know this injustice ends now.”\r\n\r\nA cheer erupted from the students, and Ilsa allowed them to go wild for a second before gesturing them to be silent again. She certainly had a flair for theatrics.\r\n\r\nMuch like the students, really – that cheer certainly wasn’t because they were honestly unable to contain their excitement.\r\n\r\n“But what exactly are spells?” she asked. “Can anyone tell me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh great,” Zorian mumbled. “A review session.”\r\n\r\nHesitant mumbling erupted in the classroom until Ilsa pointed to one particular girl, who repeated her answer of ‘structured magic’.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, spells are structured magic. To cast a spell is to invoke a particular mana construct. A construct that is, by its very nature, limited in what it can do. This is why structured spells are also called ‘bounded spells’. The shaping exercises you have been doing for the past two years – the ones that you all think are a useless chore – are unstructured magic. In theory, unstructured magic can do anything. Invocations are simply a tool to make your life easier. A crutch, some would say. To cast a bounded spell is to sacrifice flexibility and force mana into a rigid construct that can only be modified in minor ways. So why does everyone prefer invocations?”\r\n\r\nShe waited for a few moments before continuing. “In an ideal world, you would learn how to perform all your magic in an unstructured manner, bending it to your will as you please. But this is not an ideal world. Unstructured magic is slow and hard to learn, and time is precious. And besides, invocations are good enough for most purposes. They can do amazing things. Many of the things you can accomplish with invocations have never been reproduced using unstructured magic. Others…”\r\n\r\nShe took out a pen from her pocket and placed it on the table before casting what Zorian recognized as a simple ‘torch’ spell. The pen erupted in soft light that illuminated the room. Well, at least now he knew why the curtains were closed in the classroom – it was hard to effectively demonstrate light spells in broad daylight. The spell was nothing new to Zorian, though, since they were taught how to cast it last year.\r\n\r\n“The ‘torch’ invocation is one of the simplest spells, and one that you should already know by now. It is comparable to the light-emitting shaping exercise that you should also know by now.”\r\n\r\nIlsa then launched into an explanation about the relative advantages and disadvantages of the ‘torch’ spell compared to the shaping exercise, and how it related to structured vs. unstructured magic in general. For the most part, it was nothing that Zorian hadn’t known from books and lectures already, and Zorian amused himself by drawing various magical creatures in the margins of his notebook while she talked. From the corner of his eye he could see Akoja and a number of other people furiously writing everything down, even though this was just a review session and they almost certainly had all of this already written in their last year’s notebooks. He didn’t know whether to be impressed with their dedication or disgusted by their single-mindedness. He did notice, however, that some of the students had animated their pens to copy down the entire lecture while they listened. Zorian personally preferred to write notes himself, but he could see how such a spell would be useful, so he quickly jotted down a reminder to find the spell they used to do that.\r\n\r\nIlsa then began discussing dispelling – another topic they had covered exhaustively during the previous year, and also one of the key areas they had to be proficient in to pass the certification process. To be fair, it was a complex and vital topic. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to effectively dispelling a structured spell, and without knowing how to dispel your own spells, experimenting with structured magic could be disastrous. Still, one would think the academy would assume they knew it by now and move on.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the line Ilsa decided to spice up her explanation with examples and performed some kind of summoning spell that resulted in several stacks of ceramic bowls popping into existence on her table. She told Akoja to distribute the bowls to everyone, and then had them use the ‘levitate object’ spell to make the bowls hover over their tables. Compared to levitating that little girl’s bicycle out of the river, this was insultingly easy.\r\n\r\n“I see you’ve all managed to levitate your bowls,” Ilsa said. “Very good. Now I want you to cast the de-illuminator spell on it.”\r\n\r\nZorian raised his eyebrows at this. What would that achieve?\r\n\r\n“Go on,” Ilsa urged. “Don’t tell me you have already forgotten how to cast it?”\r\n\r\nZorian quickly made a couple of gestures and whispered a short chant while concentrating on the bowl. The item in question wobbled for a second before finally dropping out of the air like any normal heavier-than-air item. A plethora of clattering sounds informed him that this wasn’t an isolated occurrence. He glanced towards Ilsa for an explanation.\r\n\r\n“As you can see, the ‘levitate object’ spell can be dispelled by the ‘de-illuminator’ spell. An interesting development, don’t you agree? What does a spell designed to snuff out sources of magical light have to do with hovering objects? The truth, my young students, is that ‘de-illuminator’ is simply a specialized form of a general-purpose disruptor spell, which breaks down the structure of a spell in order to make it go away. While not designed with ‘levitate object’ in mind, it is still capable of affecting it if you supply it with enough power.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you tell us to just dispel it normally, then?” one of the girls asked.\r\n\r\n“A topic for another time,” Ilsa said without missing a beat. “For now, I want you to take notice of what happened when you dispelled the spell on the bowl – it dropped like a rock, and if it had not been magically strengthened, it would have probably shattered upon impacting the table. This is the main problem inherent in all disruptor spells. Disruptor spells are the simplest form of dispelling, and virtually every spell can be disrupted if you put enough power into the disruptor, but sometimes disrupting the spell can have worse consequences than letting it run its course. This is especially true for higher-order spells, which almost always react explosively to disruption because of the vast amount of mana that goes into their casting. Not to mention that ‘enough power’ can be far more than any mage can provide. Place your bowls on the table and put a few torn pages from your notebook into it.”\r\n\r\nZorian was somewhat surprised by Ilsa’s sudden request, but did as she said. He always found tearing paper to be somewhat cathartic, so he filled the bowl with a bit more paper than necessary, and then waited for further instructions.\r\n\r\n“I want you all to cast the ‘ignite’ spell on the paper, followed immediately by the de-illuminator on the resulting fire to dispel it,” Ilsa said.\r\n\r\nZorian sighed. This time he had caught on to what she was doing, and knew the flames would not be dispelled by the de-illuminator, but he did as she said anyway. The flames didn’t even flicker, and the fire died out on its own when it ran out of fuel.\r\n\r\n“I see all of you can cast the ignite spell perfectly,“ Ilsa said. “I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised – heating things is something that is very easy to do with magic. That and explosions. None of you managed to dispel the flames, though. Why do you suppose that is?”\r\n\r\nZorian snorted, listening to several other students trying to guess the answer. ‘Guess’ being the operative word, because they seemed to be throwing random answers around in hopes of making something stick. Normally he never volunteered for anything in class – he disliked the attention – but he was getting tired of the guessing game and Ilsa didn’t seem willing to supply the answer herself until someone figured it out.\r\n\r\n“Because there’s nothing to dispel,” he called out. “It’s just a regular fire, started by magic but not fueled by it.”\r\n\r\n“Correct,” Ilsa said. “This is another weakness of disruptor spells. They break down mana constructs, but any fundamentally non-magical effects caused by the spell are unaffected. With that in mind, let us return to our immediate problem…”\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, Zorian filed out of the classroom with his fellow classmates, actually a bit disappointed. He learned precious little during the lecture, and Ilsa said she would spend an entire month rounding out their basics before moving on to more advanced stuff. Then she gave them an essay on the topic of dispelling. It was shaping up to be a relatively boring class, since Zorian had a pretty good grasp of the basics, and they had essential invocations five times a week – that is to say, every day. Joy.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was uneventful, since the remaining four classes were purely introductory, outlining what material would be covered for each class and other such details. Essential alchemy and operation of magical items looked promising, but the other two classes were just more of the same thing they’d had for the past two years. Zorian wasn’t sure why the academy felt that they needed to continue learning about the history of magic and magical law into the third year of their education, unless they were deliberately trying to annoy everyone. This was especially true because their history teacher, an old man by the name of Zenomir Olgai, was very enthusiastic about his subject and gave them an assignment to read a 200-page history book by the end of the week.\r\n\r\nIt was a poor way to start the week in Zorian’s opinion.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nThe next day opened with combat magic, which was taught in a training hall instead of a classical classroom. Their teacher was an ex-battlemage named Kyron. It only took one look at him for Zorian to realize this was not going to be your average class.\r\n\r\nThe man standing in front of them was of average height, but he looked as if he was chiseled out of stone – bald, grim-faced, and very, very muscular. He had a rather prominent nose and he was completely shirtless, proudly displaying his rather developed chest muscles. He carried a combat staff in one hand and the ever-present green teacher’s book in the other. Had someone described the man to Zorian, he would have thought it funny, but there was nothing funny about facing this person in the flesh.\r\n\r\n“Combat magic isn’t really a category of spells as such,” Kyron said in a loud, commanding voice, more like a general talking to recruits than a teacher talking to students. It was probably the quietest class Zorian had ever been in – even chatterboxes like Neolu and Jade were silent. “More like a way of casting magic. To use spells in combat, you need to cast them fast, and you need to overcome your opponent’s defenses. This means they inevitably require a lot of power and that you shape the spell in an instant... which means that classical invocations like you learn them in other classes are useless!” He slammed his staff into the floor for emphasis, and his words reverberated throughout the training hall. Zorian could swear the man was empowering his voice with magic somehow. “Chanting a spell takes several seconds, if not longer, and most of your opponents will kill you before you finish. Especially today, in the aftermath of the Splinter Wars, when every fool is armed with a gun and educated in ways to effectively combat mages.”\r\n\r\nKyron waved his hand in the air and the air behind him shimmered, revealing a transparent phantasm of a minotaur over him. The creature looked quite angry, but it was clearly an illusion.\r\n\r\n“A lot of combat spells used by mages of old relied on people being awed by magic, or unfamiliar with its limitations. Today, every child that went through elementary school knows better than to be scared away by an obvious illusion like this one, much less a professional soldier or a criminal. Most of the spells and tactics you will find in the library are hopelessly obsolete.”\r\n\r\nKyron stopped and rubbed his chin in thought. “Also, it is somewhat hard to focus on spellcasting when someone is actively trying to kill you,” he remarked offhandedly. He shook his head. “As a consequence of all this, nobody casts combat spells as classical invocations anymore. Instead, people use spell formulas, like the one imprinted on my staff, to cast specific spells quicker and easier. I won’t even be teaching you how to cast combat spells without these items, since teaching you how to use classical invocations effectively in battle would take years. If you’re really curious, you can always browse the library for the right chants and gestures and practice on your own.”\r\n\r\nThen he handed them each a rod of magic missile and had them practice firing the spell at the clay dolls on the other end of the training hall, until their mana ran out. While he was waiting for the girl in front of him to run out of mana, Zorian studied the spell rod in his hand. It was a perfectly straight piece of wood that fit well into Zorian’s hand and could be grasped at each of the two ends without any change in effect – that being a bolt of force emerging from the tip of the rod pointing away from the caster.\r\n\r\nWhen it was finally his turn, he realized that casting with the aid of a spell formula was almost insultingly easy. He didn’t even have to think about it much, just point the rod in the desired direction and channel mana through it – the spell formula in the rod did almost everything by itself. The real problem was that ‘magic missile’ took a lot more mana than any other spell that Zorian had encountered, and he had burned through his mana reserves in only eight shots.\r\n\r\nDrained of mana and a little disappointed in how quickly he ran out, Zorian observed Zach as he fired magic missile after magic missile with lazy confidence. Zorian couldn’t help but feel a bit envious of the boy – the amount of mana Zach had to have used by now was easily three or four times bigger than his maximum. And Zach didn’t appear to be slowing down at all, either.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m going to let you all go, even though the class isn’t officially over yet,” Kyron said. “You’re all out of mana, with the exception of mister Noveda here, and combat magic is all about practice. As parting words, I must caution you to use your newly acquired combat magic with restraint and responsibility. Otherwise, I will personally hunt you down.”\r\n\r\nIf it were any other professor saying this, Zorian would have laughed, but Kyron might just be crazy enough to do it.\r\n\r\nThen it was time for spell formula class, which was the very branch of magic that was used to build the focusing aids they used in their combat magic class. Their teacher, a young woman with gravity-defying orange hair that stood up like the flame of a candle, reminded Zorian of Zenomir Olgai with her enthusiasm for the subject. Zorian actually liked spell formulas, but not quite as much as Nora Boole thought was appropriate. Her ‘recommended reading’ included 12 different books and she immediately announced that she would be organizing bonus lectures each week for those interested in learning more. Then she gave them ‘a short test’ (it had 60 questions) to check how much they remembered from their last two years. She then wrapped up the class by telling them to read the first three chapters from one of the books on her recommended reading list for the next class (which was tomorrow).\r\n\r\nAfter that, the rest of the day was like a relaxation period in comparison.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nZorian knocked on the door in front of him, nervously fidgeting in place. The first week of school was rather uneventful, aside from finding out that advanced mathematics was also taught by Nora Boole, and she was similarly enthusiastic about that subject as well, giving them another preliminary test and more ‘recommended’ reading. Still, it was now Friday, and it was time to meet his mentor.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” a voice sounded from the room, and Zorian swore he could feel the impatience in the voice already, like the man felt Zorian was wasting his time before he even saw him. He opened the door and came face to face with Xvim Chao, the notorious mentor from hell. Zorian could tell straight from his facial expression that Xvim didn’t think much of him.\r\n\r\n“Zorian Kazinski? Sit down please,” Xvim ordered, not even bothering to wait for an answer. Zorian barely caught the pen the man threw at him the moment he sat down.\r\n\r\n“Show me your basic three,” his mentor ordered, referring to the shaping exercises they were taught in their second year.\r\n\r\nHe had heard about this part. No one had ever mastered the basic three enough to impress Xvim. Sure enough, Zorian had barely begun levitating the pen when he was interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Slow,” Xvim pronounced. “It took you a full second of concentration to snap into a proper mindset. You must be faster. Start over.”\r\n\r\nStart over. Start over. Start over. He kept saying that, again and again, until Zorian realized it had been a whole hour since they had started with this. He had completely lost track of time in his attempt to focus on the exercise instead of his growing desire to ram the pen into Xvim’s eye socket.\r\n\r\n“Start over.”\r\n\r\nThe pen immediately rose into the air, before Xvim was even done talking. Really, how could he possibly get any faster than this with the exercise?\r\n\r\nHe lost focus when a marble collided with his forehead, disrupting his concentration.\r\n\r\n“You lost focus,” Xvim admonished.\r\n\r\n“You threw a marble at me!” protested Zorian, unable to quite accept that Xvim had really done something so childish. “What did you expect would happen!?”\r\n\r\n“I expected you to maintain focus on the exercise anyway,” Xvim said. “Had you truly mastered the exercise, such a minor disturbance would not have impeded you. It seems I have once again been regretfully proven right: the inadequacy of current academy curricula has stunted the growth of another promising student. It seems we have to start with the very basics of mana shaping. We will go through each of the basic three until you can do them flawlessly.”\r\n\r\n“Professor, I had those exercises mastered a year ago,” Zorian protested. He was not wasting his time with the basic three. He had already spent too much time refining those in his opinion.\r\n\r\n“You have not,” Xvim said, sounding as if he was affronted Zorian would even suggest such a thing. “Being able to perform the exercise reliably is not the same as mastering it. Besides, doing this will teach you patience and how to control your temper, which is clearly something you are having trouble with. Those are important skills for a mage to have.”\r\n\r\nZorian’s lips pressed themselves into a thin line. The man was intentionally pissing him off, Zorian was sure of it. Apparently the rumors were right and these sessions were going to be one giant exercise in frustration.\r\n\r\n“Let us start with the levitation exercise,” Xvim said, oblivious to Zorian’s musings. “Start over.”\r\n\r\nHe was starting to hate those two words.');

('Lift Together', 'Beware of Chicken', 10, 'The day was done. They all sat, exhausted, against the wall of Jin’s hut. Even tireless Jin had started to falter. But now, they sat together, hot and sweaty. Yun Ren and Gou Ren were down to their loincloths, slumped to the side and greedily drinking water. Even Meiling was stripped to the waist, with only her dudou preserving her modesty, groaning at the state of her sore fingers and back. Even Big D had been enlisted, carrying Meiling’s completed baskets to Jin, and getting more fibers so that she could weave.\r\n\r\nBut they were done. True to Jin’s words, at the end of the second day, the last of the rice was harvested.\r\n\r\n83 40-kilo bags of rice. An extraordinary number, for the small amount of land that Jin had put to plough.\r\n\r\nYun Ren sighed with contentment after he finished his drink, running his hands through his matted sweaty hair, and grinned at the vessel. A bamboo tube, with a groove cut in it, so that a lid could be screwed on. Meiling was having trouble opening hers, her red, overworked fingers shaking and slipping, until Jin reached over and opened it for her.\r\n\r\n“Brother Jin, this is quite the vessel. It’s certainly easier to work with in the fields.” He said, and made to hand the empty thing to Jin, who shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Keep it, Brother Yun Ren. They’re easy enough to make. I actually broke a couple gourds when I first started, and spilled a lot of water. These were more durable, and easier to clean.”\r\n\r\nGou Ren moaned, pushing himself up into a seated position. “Brother Jin, you worked us like oxen,” He complained, but looked with pride upon the many baskets, “But to see the work done is always a pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“It is, isn’t it?” Jin asked with a soft smile. They sat in companionable silence, the cool breeze a balm upon their sweaty bodies.\r\n\r\nEventually, Jin got up and stretched. “Come on, let’s get cleaned up, and then I’ll start dinner. We’re having crayfish tonight.”\r\n\r\nThe river was still warm at this time of year, and with the small bar of soap that Jin had, the dirt and grime was washed from their bodies. It told of their exhaustion that the normally quarrelsome brothers did not even try to dunk each other once, nor attempt to start any splash war.\r\n\r\nInstead, Yun Ren simply handed his brother a comb. Grumbling Gou Ren dutifully brushed first his elder brother’s hair, and then Meiling’s while Jin prepared for them a meal.\r\n\r\nFirst, he dredged up the baskets along the river. Then, Jin split the crayfish in two, removing it’s gut, and then in his wok, added peppercorns and oil, as well as leek, ginger, and garlic. He fried it until the crayfish was red, and then served it over rice.\r\n\r\nBig D dined on the leftover crayfish.\r\n\r\nThis time, everybody camped out in Jin’s little house. Meiling did not even offer a token attempt at subtlety, simply pulling Jin into the bed with her, much to the brother’s amusement.\r\n\r\n“Oh no, brother! We must act to preserve Brother Jin’s purity!” Yun Ren japed. “No wonder Elder Hong sent us along, his daughter is a lusty beast!”\r\n\r\nGou Ren snorted, and looked at them with tired eyes. “I think hes fine. Shes already asleep.”\r\n\r\nYun Ren barked out another laugh. “Indeed,” he said, and sat down. He had a considering look on his face.\r\n\r\n“Brother Jin?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Brother Yun Ren?”\r\n\r\n“Take good care of our Meiling, yeah?”\r\n\r\nJin nodded, and pulled Meiling closer to his body.\r\n\r\n“To the best of my ability.”\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\n“Mph. Gou Ren, you lout, off.” Meiling woke to the sounds of and annoyed Yun Ren, Gou Ren having rolled over onto him in the night.\r\n\r\nIt was still the early hours of the morning. Meiling sat up and yawned, stretching to get the kinks out of her back.\r\n\r\nThere were none. In fact, she felt great, despite the work she had done. Her muscles were still sore, but there was none of the outright pain that she was expecting. Jin was still asleep beside her, as was Gou Ren, but Yun Ren was already sitting up, looking annoyed at his brother.\r\n\r\n“Good morning.” Meiling whispered to him, and got a muttered greeting in return.\r\n\r\n“Start the fire, I’ll get the eggs?” Meiling whispered, and Yun Ren nodded, holding a hand to his arm and stretching.\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then stretched his arm further back. He looked content, and then got up to grab the wood, while Meiling went to the coops. On the way out of the house, she noticed Bi De, the spirit beast, on one of the fence posts. He turned to her, in the light of the pre-dawn, and bowed.\r\n\r\nMeiling returned the greeting. The chicken nodded, satisfied, and then, to her surprise, hopped onto her shoulder with a light step, like he did with Jin. Her hand came up, and she stroked his magnificent chest feathers to approving clucking sounds.\r\n\r\nGathering the eggs was easy. Bi De simply squawked, and the hens moved aside obligingly. Yun Ren had the fire started when she got back, and the first light of dawn creased the horizon. Bi De lept from Meiling’s shoulder, back onto the fence posts, and greeted the morning.\r\n\r\nJin thanked them both, as they cooked breakfast, and Jin went off to start loading his cart for the trip back to Hong Yaowu.\r\n\r\nFor breakfast was eggs and leftover rice, shared in good company.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nMeiling held on for dear life as the cart careened down the road. Beside her, Yun Ren prayed.\r\n\r\n“Honoured ancestors, preserve your unworthy son, for he is a fool of great proportions..”\r\n\r\nGou Ren, naturally, was howling with laughter at their predicament.\r\n\r\nIt had started after they had loaded the cart, with a full forty bags of rice being loaded and strapped down. The cart was most certainly overloaded, the frame bending, but not breaking under the immense weight. Gou Ren had praised the craftsmanship, but Meiling noticed the truth. It had Jin’s qi in it.\r\n\r\nThey were ready to go back home. Jin bid goodbye to his spirit beast, who bowed low to him in supplication, and took up his vigil on the fence of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe Xong brothers looked worried about the load, and were gauging how they could help push it, when Jin lifted the front of the cart with ease, and without a hint of effort, began to walk with it.\r\n\r\nThey looked at eachother, and shrugged.\r\n\r\nThe pace was pleasant, and the weather mild as they set off, but it was already nearing noon.\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow evening I’d reckon,” Gou Ren said, looking up at the sky. “Maybe a bit longer, my legs are still sore.”\r\n\r\nMeiling agreed. The pain was coming back, though it still wasn’t that bad.\r\n\r\nJin gestured to the cart. “Hop on, I’ll get us there by tonight.”\r\n\r\nIt was quite rude, for them to sit, and have Jin cart them around like he was their lesser, but he was insistent.\r\n\r\nSo they got onto the cart, on top of the bags, and Jin bid them to hold on.\r\n\r\nAnd then he started running.\r\n\r\nWhich led them here. Hanging onto a cart of rice, while Jin ran as fast as a horse.\r\n\r\n“Brother Jin, can you go any faster?!” Gou Ren asked excitedly.\r\n\r\n“DON’T YOU DARE, JIN ROU!” Meiling screeched, top preoccupied with holding on to slap the idiot for his idea.\r\n\r\nYun Ren just kept praying.\r\n\r\nJin was right. They reached Hong Yaowu by nightfall.\r\n\r\nMeiling and Yun Ren were pale, while Gou Ren wanted to hook up the hogs to a wagon to recreate the experience.\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\nOne of the scout-searchers had returned. It stunk-smelled of joy musk.\r\n\r\n“Yes-yes. We have scent-smelled it. The fine-good qi, and tasty-delicious food.”\r\n\r\nLord-Master was intrigued. These lands were bad-poor. They had been defeated-crushed and driven out of their First-original nest-warrens, in the lands of much-plenty. Many-Many of their number-count had perished, and they were all that were left-remained.\r\n\r\nTo find-locate a new place of qi? They would need it to grow-restore their numbers.\r\n\r\n“Good-Good. Find-Locate the Land’s guardian, and seek-know it’s Might-strength.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Yes, Lord-Master. I hear and obey!” Its servant scurried off.\r\n\r\nThe Lord-Master nodded, and turned to one of it’s other servants.\r\n\r\n“Wake-Rouse the Nest-Warren. We go-move tonight.” '),
('Like You\'ve Seen a Ghost', 'Cinnamon Bun', 2, 'I swung my foot around, searching for purchase across the stony wall until I felt an outcropping big enough that the toes of my shoe could grab on. Bouncing a few times, I tested my weight and balance on the hold, then gently moved my other foot around while lowering my body.\r\n\r\nI had been climbing for a whole ten minutes already, and so far my descent had lowered me by maybe six or so feet. It was hard and slow and a little nerve-wracking. Not having any ropes was the worst part of it.\r\n\r\nMy original goal had been to climb all the way to the bottom, but there was a window a whole lot closer to the ground and it didn’t seem to be blocked by anything, any frame it might have held long gone.\r\n\r\nCrossing my fingers---metaphorically, because if I let go of the wall I would go splat--I hoped that there would be a way to move down the tower from within.\r\n\r\nIt was some long, sweaty work, with the sun straight above and beaming down on my head, but I managed to make it close enough to the side of the window to peek inside.\r\n\r\nThe room was a mess, with large wooden racks toppled over and part of the floor, wooden this time, burned though. Still, other than a few cobweb-weaving spiders there wasn’t much to see.\r\n\r\nI stepped on the window sill and crouched down before placing one foot on the floor. It held my weight with no creaking or bouncing, so I hopped down. I had made it! The door to this room was a splintered mess on the ground, as if someone had burst through in a hurry, and I could kind of guess why.\r\n\r\nThis was an armory. There were racks for armour off to one side, with a few scraps of cloth and leather left behind.\r\n\r\nLoot!\r\n\r\nWith an eager giggle I bounced over to the racks and tried picking up some neat looking pauldrons, but the leather was dry and cracked and broke apart almost as soon as I grabbed it. The cloth armour beneath was little better.\r\n\r\nThis place had been abandoned for a long time, I guessed.\r\n\r\nThe racks that had tumbled over looked like they were meant to hold weapons on them, spears or swords. I started toeing around the rubble and a couple of pokes with my foot revealed some spearheads lying on the ground, shafts long gone. The racks were made of sturdier wood, or wood that didn’t rot, maybe.\r\n\r\nAnd then I found it.\r\n\r\nNearly buried under a pile of wood and coloured nearly the same brown was a sword. Not just any sword, but a huge thing that was longer than my entire armspan.\r\n\r\nIt took plenty of grunting and lifting and some more sweat to yank it out, but soon enough I held my prize before me. The sword was bent in its middle, and the edge was nicked quite badly, and maybe it was a teensy bit very rusted, but I now had a sword!\r\n\r\nI spun around, sword raised above my head in victory and cheered.\r\n\r\n“Rwraa,” someone, or something, said.\r\n\r\nI froze, body going rigid at the sound.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t alone.\r\n\r\nLowering my new sword, I moved towards the door, carefully avoiding the burnt hole in the ground in case I fell through. I tried to move as silently as I could as I poked my head out into a corridor lined with slitted windows on either side. The tower was apparently part of a bigger facility, placed at a corner where two long corridors met. One ended about two dozen meters to my right in a staircase that dropped down, the other passage was blocked by fallen masonry, the light of day shining through the cracks.\r\n\r\n“Hello?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Rrer.”\r\n\r\nThe noise was... a growl? Maybe? It sounded more like the kind of noise I’d make if you were to try and poke me awake. It came from the passage with the stairs.\r\n\r\nPlacing my sword on my shoulder, I moved towards the nearest arrow slit, this one facing the opposite direction from the wall I had scaled down.\r\n\r\nThere was a town!\r\n\r\nNot a big one. I counted fifteen roofs, most just a little lower than the level I was on, and in bad need of some patchwork. Some looked to have been lit on fire a long time ago, timbers showing past missing roof tiles. The building I was in seemed to be a tall wall that circled all the way around the town, another tower placed on the opposite end from where I was.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot you could tell about people from the kind of house they lived in. All of these had different sorts of shingles, with most of them a sort of dull clay-red. Every house had a chimney and I couldn’t see any wires running from home to home.\r\n\r\nThat confirmed a few things for me. Whoever had lived here was human-sized. The armour helped narrow that down too.\r\n\r\nI moved on. There would be plenty of time to explore soon. I was certainly looking forward to it!\r\n\r\nThe descent to the next floor down was much easier with steps as opposed to rock climbing. I wholeheartedly approved of steps. The bottom floor was a mess. Old soggy papers turned to mulch on the ground, barely leaving an imprint, stains that I hoped weren’t blood. Lots of signs that there had been a fire.\r\n\r\nThere was an exit, at one time, a sort of archway with a large door in it leading into the village, but it had collapsed. And under the pile of rubble from that collapse was the mysterious stranger making all that noise.\r\n\r\nI swallowed as I stared at the skeleton stuck under a few choice stones. Glowing eyes fixed onto me and its head and neck wobbled a little, the one arm that wasn’t pinned in place wiggling futilely in my direction. “Rraaer,” it said.\r\n\r\nThe room across from the archway where the skeleton was pinned looked like a sort of office space. Big old desks covered in rotting papers and the tattered remains of a flag on one wall. Another wall had had a hole blown through it, revealing a bunch of beds in neat rows with chests next to them.\r\n\r\nNothing that could hurt me.\r\n\r\n“Ah, hi?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Rrr,” the skeleton replied. He seemed dead set on hurting me.\r\n\r\nI held back an inappropriate giggle and moved closer. “Hey there,” I said in the same voice I would use to greet a doggy. “You’re a nice skeleton aren’t you? Yes you are!”\r\n\r\n“Rraarararrr!” the skeleton replied. He didn’t like that I was coming closer.\r\n\r\n“So, magic really is real around here,” I said, the giddiness in my tummy returning. “I’m sorry, Mister Skeleton. Didn’t mean to disturb your rest.”\r\n\r\nI should probably have considered burying the poor thing. It was rather pitiful. Then again, I had yet to explore the rest of the tower. Maybe there was a crypt I could put him in? Or a nice graveyard. I considered using my handy dandy new sword, but Mister Skeleton had never done anything to me.\r\n\r\n“Is it mister or miss skeleton?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Rrr.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm,” I hummed. “How about Bonesy. Nice and gender, and life, neutral.”\r\n\r\n“Rraarrara.”\r\n\r\n“I agree,” I said. “It’s a fine name.” I reached down and patted Bonesy where it couldn’t reach its head. “I’ll be back.”\r\n\r\nThe office was split into two parts. The front more of a reception area of some sort and the back a more private and secluded office. With the little light coming in from the passage where Bonesy was resting it was hard to tell.\r\n\r\nI searched through the desks, prying drawers open with my Greatsword of Prying +1 but only found rotten knick knacks and some papers that were impossible to read in the low light. I stacked those that looked to be in better shape on the desk nearest the exit.\r\n\r\nThe big office at the back didn’t have much more in it. A few bottles tucked in the desk, still closed and with labels that, when brought to the light, revealed designs of grapes on them. A rusted flask, a dagger that was in even worse shape than my sword.\r\n\r\nThere was a chest behind the desk, in surprisingly good shape, but I couldn’t find a way to open it.\r\n\r\nI managed to drag it closer to the front, but the effort wasn’t worth it, and my Greatsword of Prying +1 wasn’t tough enough to open the chest. All I managed was to make the tip break off when I tried.\r\n\r\nGiving up for now, I moved into the barracks.\r\n\r\nThe mattresses were all filled with rotting hay and the entire room stank of mildew. The smell only grew worse when I found a small bathroom of sorts tucked in the back. Each chest was opened and each of them was a disappointment. They were either empty already or the only things within were old and stinky.\r\n\r\nWorn boots, some cloth that resembled swiss cheese, a few belts that were stiffer than my sword. I did find a few coppery coins that had turned green with verdigris spilling out of a pierced sack, and one chest had a haversack that was in decent shape. It was empty, but that changed as soon as I put my newfound coppery wealth in it.\r\n\r\nA peek into the bathroom revealed something neat. There was a shower, which confused me until I noticed the stone covered in strange glyphs held by a sort of metal sconce above.\r\n\r\nMagic showers! Neat.\r\n\r\nI found a sort of pad on the wall that had a corresponding glyph on it, but pressing did nothing.\r\n\r\nPressing and pouting also did nothing. But pressing and pushing with my mind, as if I had to poop really bad, made the glyph above glow and a spray of water came out. It was weak, and lukewarm, and I might have shrieked when it splattered onto my head, but it was water.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t going to die of dehydration! Yay!\r\n\r\nThe only other thing of interest was a small cupboard filled with cleaning supplies. A mop that didn’t look usable, some clothes that were moth worn but still usable. Another broom and a dustpan and bucket.\r\n\r\nWell, I already had some levels in cleaning...\r\n\r\nI weighed the value of cleaning out the old barracks against resuming my explorations. In the end, exploration won out handily.\r\n\r\nGrinning from ear to ear, I pressed on past Bonesy and down the main corridor inside the wall. A convenient hole in the wall allowed me to squeeze out of the barracks with my haversack and sword in tow.\r\n\r\nI had a town to explore! If I was lucky I would find some food and a place to rest for later. Maybe some clothes and a way to contact people. Oh, and magical tomes, and ancient swords and of course a bunch of new friends!\r\n\r\nIt was going to be brilliant!\r\n\r\nI exited behind a stout little house that was squished between two others. There had been a fence behind it, but it was torn apart at some point long ago. I moved around the house, intending to circle the town and see everything before checking in the houses one by one. A map would have been nice, or a Geography for Dummies book in English.\r\n\r\nInstead, as I rounded the corner of the house and moved into an alleyway, I came face-to-back with a floating, white specter.\r\n\r\nIt was a person, sorta. A hazy image suspended in the air, their clothes fluttering in a wind that I couldn’t feel. I felt colder just watching them. Not a metaphorical cold either.\r\n\r\n“H-hello! My name is Broccoli, do you want to be friends?” I asked.\r\n\r\nThe ghost turned around slowly, its placid, bored face tilting down to look at me. Then its features turned ugly and it screeched.\r\n\r\nYou have heard the screech of a fearsome creature! Your soul is shaken.\r\n\r\nI shook. Arms and legs and chest wobbling as the ghost moved in closer, one hand moving back as it got ready to swipe at me.\r\n\r\nMy sword! I remembered my sword and flung the heavy piece of steel at the ghost, only to see it fly through the monster and bounce on the ground behind it. “Oh, shoot. I’m sorry Mister Ghost I didn’t mean to and I’m sorry and oh I don’t want to die, I’m leaving now!”\r\n\r\nI turned tail and ran.'),
('Mushroom Farming', 'There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.', 3, 'Delta looked down at the floor just near the entrance. She tried to push down the red outline of the pitfall but it buzzed angry as it refused to form. Delta frowned and peered closely.\r\n\r\nThe soil floor had a slight white tinge to it. The same feeling of the barrier that stopped Delta from going outside. It was a clear sign that whatever power that granted her these dungeon making skills, that they also prevented her from booby trapping the first step or ten into her dungeon.\r\n\r\nThat posed a problem.\r\n\r\n“François? Can you leave the dungeon?” she asked the goblin in her core room. Fran, as she took to calling him, shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I dungeon make. Can’t leave,” he answered then before Delta could ponder further, he pointed to Hob and Gob.\r\n\r\n“Contracted. Lose power but gobs can leave for small while,” he scratched at his large green nose. Delta turned her attention to the two brothers.\r\n\r\n“Great! Guys, I need you to go fetch me something from outside, plants, insects, anything that’s got mana!” Delta directed and both of the goblins bowed, Hob falling over entirely before the scrambled up the tunnel and outside.\r\n\r\nThey both visibly shrank and looked tired but ran off with their new task.\r\n\r\nGoblins weren’t cute but Delta liked their attitude. Sighing, she turned to the single long tunnel where one could easily see her core. Three problems jumped out of her.\r\n\r\nA man with a gun or a bow and arrow or hell, even a fireball could snipe her from the entrance. Two, it was unprotected from any advancing melee fighters and three, she felt naked.\r\n\r\nLike standing near a window with no clothes on. She had no choice, Delta needed to protect herself with space until she had more. She could stuff the tunnel filled with goblins but something told her that would only draw people faster…\r\n\r\nWalking down, Delta stopped midway and tried to puzzle how she was going to plan this.\r\n\r\nShe had an… awareness of her entire dungeon, where everything was as well as whom. It was tiny and for the first time, Delta felt a hint of shame on how basic her layout was. Was that a dungeon thing or just herself latching onto anything to get her mind off her current predicament?\r\n\r\nShe tried to close the tunnel leading to her core, cutting off any entrance to her core room but there was a resounding error in the response. Such a thing… wasn’t possible. Delta grabbed her head as she squeezed her eyes shut to endure the sudden headache. After a moment, it passed.\r\n\r\n“That… sucked,” she said slowly as the pain ebbed away, slowly.\r\n\r\nLesson learned, they’re had to be a route to her core. This was some fundamental rule that Delta couldn’t ignore.\r\n\r\nThese rules were becoming annoying.\r\n\r\nRule 1: The entrance must be a safe zone of some kind.\r\n\r\nRule 2: The core must be reachable by all that enter.\r\n\r\nDelta snarled at the iron rules that basically meant she couldn’t just hide and build up a sizeable power base. If someone came, and they wiped her goblins, she was fucked.\r\n\r\nNo… she had options.\r\n\r\nThe idea just hit her.\r\nWhere was her dungeon exactly?\r\n\r\n“Fran? Where are we?” she asked suddenly and Fran paused.\r\n\r\n“Fran is new name?” it asked and Delta hummed in agreement. The dungeon rumbled just a little and above the goblin’s head words appeared.\r\n\r\n“Fran — Rare Goblin”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Fran is named!” he hollered and danced. Delta just gaped.\r\n\r\n“What… but I already gave you a name before…” she argued weakly and Fran shook his head at your orb.\r\n\r\n“Random name, not important. Fran is personal, it’s mine!” the goblin said with another dance. Delta peered at the title.\r\n\r\nRare huh? Like a mob that had a 1 in 10 chance of appearing? It… didn’t seem to cost her any mana so what was the drawback?\r\n\r\n“So two questions, what does it mean to be rare and where exactly is my dungeon?” Delta inquired politely.\r\n\r\nFran paused mid-jig.\r\n\r\n“Rare means special. Fran is first-floor special!” the goblin answered with a little pride in his voice. Then he scratched his head.\r\n\r\n“Dungeon is… near forest. Hob and Gob said so,” he tried and Delta mentally drew little tree symbols on her mental map.\r\n\r\nForest was good. So, mostly grass hills and a forest somewhere nearby. That meant plants, small animals and maybe some big animals!\r\n\r\nIf she just needed them to die in her dungeon to gain mana, she can move a lot quicker in getting her core somewhere safe.\r\n\r\nThen she could figure out what it was going to mean to exist as a dungeon core that lured people to their deaths.\r\n\r\nFor one, Delta didn’t want to simply be known as a murderhobo dungeon. She wanted a little more than that. A theme or… something.\r\n\r\nThe useless planning for the future was nice, it let Delta’s mind wander as she stood in the middle of the tunnel and pushed with her power.\r\n\r\nThe soil in front of her just broke apart and vanished as it moved further down in a tunnel big enough for two men to stand side by side in.\r\n\r\nIt went so far and just stopped. Delta examined her map and wondered if she could curve tunnels…\r\n\r\nOh, she could. A little narrow near the curves but it worked out as she spent the last ten mana she had on connecting her new tunnel to the core room.\r\n\r\nWith little effort, she appeared in the main tunnel and with a little tremble, closed the space between her core room and the entrance.\r\n\r\nIt filled in without a problem. It took no mana to remove her spaces, to grow smaller...\r\n\r\nThe sight was beautiful, Delta grinned and the sudden tiredness was quickly making her eyes droop. Then Hob and Gob returned with both their hands full of a mushroom each. Four mushrooms. They looked at each other and seemed puzzled by the lack of core room, but they suddenly bulged and grew back to their Delta-forms.\r\n\r\nA tentative name. Naming things made her feel better. They rushed to the core room, and dropped the mushrooms at Delta’s earthy alter.\r\n\r\n“Rooms!” they cried. The mushrooms hit her dungeon floor and were quickly turned into those odd motes.\r\n\r\nThey entered Delta’s mind, and the taste followed them.\r\n\r\nDelta gagged.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to throw up, but she had no mouth.\r\n\r\nSo, she just tried to cough up the taste.\r\n\r\nThe frick was wrong with those things?!\r\n\r\n“Most dangerous rooms! Nothing else want them!” Hob bragged. Gob nodded in agreement and dropped two more on the ground from a small fur pouch he had.\r\n\r\n“N-no!” Delta begged but they were already dissolving.\r\n\r\nThe taste returned and Delta felt herself die a little. As she laid there, sobbing, the little mana bar in her menu shot up by six. One for each mushroom.\r\n\r\nThen another bar appeared.\r\n\r\nDungeon points: 36\r\n\r\nDungeon points? Delta stood with a groan.\r\n\r\n“Please… try to find something else,” she begged the two goblins. Hob and Gob took off with a bow, laughing with their ‘success’.\r\n\r\nDelta opened a menu and frowned.\r\n\r\n“What do I do with dungeon points?” she asked and there was no answer.\r\n\r\nShe fiddled with the menu for a moment.\r\n\r\nWith some close examination, she found something she hadn’t seen before. A little ‘+’ symbol hidden near bottom of the main menu.\r\n\r\nShe touched it and winced as things appeared all over the menu.\r\n\r\n    Dungeon points: 36\r\n\r\n    Purchase Monster\r\n\r\n    Purchase TrapPurchase Construction\r\n\r\n    Upgrade MonsterUpgrade Trap\r\n    Upgrade room\r\n\r\nDelta blinked and clicked the first option. Purchase Monster.\r\n\r\n    Monster Purchase:\r\n\r\n        Goblin - Starter.\r\n        Common Bat: 5 DP\r\n        Common Spider: 5 DP\r\n        Mushroom Spitter: 30 DP (Special requirement unlocked: Absorb a deadly poisonous mushroom)\r\n\r\nHad she unlocked a monster? Delta thought about it. She didn’t see anything about humans, like the ones that had come before. Maybe there was some hidden clause to unlock more rare monsters?\r\n\r\nIf she devoured rare stone, could she make golems? Make wolves if she killed some in her dungeon?\r\n\r\nThis opened a lot of options… Gob and Hob were amazing, they could farm her materials!\r\n\r\nDelta flicked through the other menus quickly.\r\n\r\n    Construction Purchase:\r\n\r\n        Lair: 20 DP (one per level)\r\n        Next Level - Locked\r\n        Boss room: 40 DP (one per level)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Trap Purchase:\r\n\r\n        Sticky Floor Panel: 10 DP\r\n        Weak Tripwire: 5 DP\r\n        Falling Rock (Weak): 10 DP\r\n\r\nUpgrade room and monster were greyed out for the moment. Delta could only assume she didn’t have the requirements to upgrade anything just yet.\r\n\r\nHer eyes lingered on the mushroom spitter… she had eaten that damn mushroom and it did say it was an earned monster…\r\n\r\nThat DP cost was pretty high but at this point, if she was going to be forced to eat more of those disgusting mushrooms, she deserved this,\r\n\r\nShe purchased the mushrooms, dropping her DP to 6.\r\n\r\nDelta switched menus and saw her monster now had two options.\r\n\r\n    Goblin: 10 Mana\r\n    Mushroom Spitter: 13 Mana\r\n\r\nNeat… now she just had to get enough mana to summon her new monster. Hopefully, Hob and Gob would be successful in finding something… that wasn’t… those mushrooms.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGob ran, he hollered as a pitchfork flew over his head and the pig in his hands squealed with terror.\r\n\r\nPink flabby meat for the master!\r\n\r\nHob ran with his arms full of mushrooms, the master’s favourite!\r\n\r\nShe had gasped and was speechless when they had given them to her. She’d love more! The master just wanted side meat to go with them!\r\n\r\nBut first, the silly mans were closing in and the dungeon was coming near…\r\n\r\nPigs for the master!\r\n\r\nHob found another ‘room and picked it up as he ran past.\r\n\r\nMore ‘rooms for the master!\r\n\r\n---'),
('Nothing But a Hound Dog', 'Beware of Chicken', 4, 'There were many ways Meiling expected her day to go. Watching over the children, collecting herbs, making medicine, tending to whoever got hurt.\r\n\r\nShe was not expecting… this.\r\n\r\nShe was reading a medical scroll when the scent came to her, seemingly carried on the breeze. The boy. He had the stench of qi about him, thicker and headier than she had ever smelled before. He was even more powerful than last time she had laid eyes on him, when he had shared a meal with her father in good spirits, after asking about how they grew their rice.\r\n\r\nWhen the children’s ball struck the tall, broad-shouldered boy pulling a loaded wagon with more ease than an ox, her heart had leapt to her throat. Mud now coated his clothes. All knew that cultivators did not suffer such things. She still remembered many years ago, when she and her father had travelled to the city, and the contemptuous ease with which a cultivator had slain a beggar child for having the gall to get in his way.\r\n\r\nWhen little Xian had rushed to retrieve his ball, she rushed with him, desperate to beg for her little brother’s life.\r\n\r\nInstead, the young man had started laughing.\r\n\r\nHe gave back their ball… and then joined the children in the mud pit.\r\n\r\nNow, the cultivator, for that is only what the young man could be, cackled as he danced through the mud, dodging the children of the village throwing themselves at him in an attempt to knock him into the wallow with grace and skill. He gently diverted them into the muck with wet splats, or picked them up and carried them around the pit, tickling all the while.\r\n\r\nHe had steadily drawn an audience, and more children. At first, the adults too were weary, but now most had wandered off, or sat around the edges and smiled at the silly boy and the kids.\r\n\r\n“Haha! You’re a thousand years too early to defeat me!” He laughed at them, hands on his hips. “My chicken is mightier than all of you!”\r\n\r\nThe children shreiked in outrage, and her dear little brother turned to her.\r\n\r\n“Meimei! Meimei! Help us Big sister Meimei!” he pleaded.\r\n\r\nAnd sealed her doom.\r\n\r\nNot in the traditional sense of a girl being doomed by a cultivator, for she was no beauty, thin and freckly as she was.\r\n\r\nInstead, a massive, gleeful grin spread across the cultivator’s face, and he approached her.\r\n\r\n“Oho?” he asked, leering down at her, “Another challenger?”\r\n\r\n“So what if I am?” She demanded of him, unable to back down under the pleading gazes of the children.\r\n\r\nHe scooped her up, one hand going under her legs, and the other cradling her back. There was no effort to his movement, it was if she weighed nothing at all.\r\n\r\nShe flushed, as she was bought into strong, firm arms… and then the boy unceremoniously jumped into the mud pit with her held securely in his arms.\r\n\r\nIn her clean clothes. After she had just had a bath yesterday.\r\n\r\nShe had no idea what “Ca Wa Bun Ga” meant, but as she felt the mud slop into her clothes, she saw red.\r\n\r\n“You wretched, pig-headed shitmonkey!” she howled, ignoring the fact that she was surrounded by children, and launched herself at the boy who was laughing so hard he had doubled over. Her tackle shoved him over backwards, and into the mud fully. The adults, including her own father, found the entire thing hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe children cheered for their champion, and the boy dashed around the mud pit, and she threw herself after him.\r\n\r\n/////\r\n\r\n“Meiling the hellion!” her father teased her as she prepared dinner. She stuck her nose up in the air contemptuously, and refused to rise to the ribbing.\r\n\r\nThey were to have dinner with that bastard, and she was mightily displeased. Well, most of the village was going to be having dinner with him, but they, as the chiefs of this small village, would have to have that bastard in their home.\r\n\r\nAt least that bastard had provided two deer and several rabbits for them.\r\n\r\nGods, she hated the cultivator and his strong arms and his chiseled jaw….\r\n\r\nGeh! No! She shook her head to clear away the treacherous images her mind provided for her.\r\n\r\nAnd nobody believed her that he was powerful, either. “Sure your nose isn’t off, Meimei?” They had asked, for no cultivator got into a mud fight with children, or went and made friends with peasants.\r\n\r\nEven she was starting to doubt herself, but her ability to smell qi had never steered her wrong before.\r\n\r\nHe would expose his wicked nature soon enough.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the preparation was fortunately uneventful. There were tables set up in the middle of the village, and a great amount of food would be there for everyone to enjoy. They too would be setting out on their visit to Verdant Hill, that they did once every two months.\r\n\r\nMeiling kept a close eye on him, but the cultivator spent most of the time playing go with the men, and losing spectacularly.\r\n\r\nShe had felt uneasy when her best friend, Meihua, had bought them tea. Meihua was everything she wasn’t. She was the classical beauty, with flawless pale skin and full red lips. The few times they went to Verdant Hill, men stopped and stared, struck dumb by her lovliness. She had received marriage proposals from over fifty men, but was determined to marry the clerk Tingfeng.\r\n\r\nSurely, the cultivator would accost her. In all the stories, they were as beasts upon beautiful women!\r\n\r\n“Oh? You’re getting married soon? Congratulations! Wait– here. I don’t know If I can make the wedding, but thats no excuse not to give a gift!”\r\n\r\nInstead, he gave Meihua the most vibrant fox pelt she had ever seen, congratulated her on her upcoming marriage–\r\n\r\nAnd then turned back to the Go table, laughing as he lost again.\r\n\r\n…..maybe her nose was playing tricks on her.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nMan, that Meimei girl was glaring really hard at me, like an offended cat. It was pretty cute, the way her freckly nose scrunched up.\r\n\r\nThe look on her face was hilarious when I dumped her in the mud, though.\r\n\r\nTotally worth it.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nIt was the dead of night when she woke up, drenched in cold sweat.\r\n\r\nThere was something out there. It stunk of blood and death. Of hate and malice. The terror was nearly overwhelming, sending shakes down her back as the wicked qi invaded the village.\r\n\r\nAnd then, it was suppressed. The cultivator’s qi shoved the bestial qi backwards, repelling the blood and rot with the scent of freshly tilled soil and harvested rice. The fear and dread was repulsed.\r\n\r\nThe cultivator rose from his room, and went to confront the beast.\r\n\r\nMeiling, her legs shaking, followed.\r\n\r\nShe had to know.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nI woke up with an itching feeling crawling down my spine. I could feel some sort of predator nearby, but without Big D to sound the alarm, I hadn’t acted. Groggily, I rolled myself off the futon and stretched.\r\n\r\nEh, might as well take care of it. I grabbed my shovel from my possessions, and wandered out of the house. The fires were still smouldering a little, and I smiled at them. Today had been fun. Childish as hell, but fun. And those dumplings Meimei made were really good.\r\n\r\nThough when I told her that, she scrunched up her nose at me. That girl was too fun to tease.\r\n\r\nI ambled into the forest, following my gut feeling, until I found the wolf.\r\n\r\nOh, man, hes a biggun, isn’t he? Needs his toenails trimmed too.\r\n\r\nIt snarled, and pounced.\r\n\r\n///////////////\r\n\r\nShe followed the cultivator through the winding forest, the scent of blood battling against the smell of earth. She could barely hear, for how hard her heart was pounding, but the cultivator didn’t seem to notice her foot falls.\r\n\r\nAt last they came to the source of the horrific qi, and her blood turned to ice.\r\n\r\nA Reaper Wolf. The Reaper Wolf, The Wicked Blade. It had been around these parts for nearly three hundred years, and had even killed a cultivator!\r\n\r\nWhat was it doing here?! Were they all to die tonight?\r\n\r\nShe cowered behind the tree, and prayed for Jin’s soul, to face such a monster.\r\n\r\nThe Reaper Wolf moved faster than her eyes could see, pouncing on him in a storm of bladed claws.\r\n\r\nThe shovel met it. Klang! It went, striking the fell beast in the center of the head, and slaying it\r\n\r\nShe gaped stupidly at the scene. The cultivator yawned. “Bad Dog.” he muttered, and rubbed at his eye.\r\n\r\nHe took no blood, nor it’s teeth, nor the Wicked Blade’s core. Instead, his shovel went to work, digging a hole big enough for the beast, and burying it in moments.\r\n\r\n“No hard feelings, buddy?” he muttered to the soil, and pressed some of his qi into it. She thought she could hear a wail for a brief moment in her head, and then the lingering scent of blood vanished.\r\n\r\nShe was still standing there in shock when he started walking back to the village. The cultivator squinted at her crouched form.\r\n\r\n“Need a ride back?” he asked her, and her mouth moved before she thought it through..\r\n\r\n“The last time you gave me a ride you threw me into a mud pit.” She said, sounding more annoyed than she felt.\r\n\r\nJin chuffed in amusement, and then gestured forwards.\r\n\r\n“Well come on, dangerous wildlife out here.” he said. “You can make me some dumplings again, as thanks for escorting you home.”\r\n\r\nShe scoffed as if she found the idea distasteful, much to Jin’s amusement, and stood on shaking legs as they left.\r\n\r\nShe turned one last time to look at the overturned dirt.\r\n\r\nThere were grass shoots growing out of it.\r\n\r\nHer father was waiting for them, when they got back to her house, worried about her safety and virtue. “What happened?” he asked. “All of the animals kicked up such a fuss!”\r\n\r\n“Eh, just a wolf.” Jin said sounding unconcerned.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Meiling agreed, “Just a wolf, father.”\r\n\r\nJust a wolf indeed. \r\n');

('Of Gaps And Pretending\r\n', 'Mother of Learning', 7, 'At first, Zorian hadn’t even noticed him. That was noteworthy by itself, as Zach wasn’t an easy person to overlook. The boy loved attention and seemed to have trouble staying still and quiet, something that remained consistent even after Zach suddenly turned into some kind of a weirdo time traveler. Today, however, the normally loud and exuberant boy remained eerily silent. He also eschewed his typical tactic of sitting in the back of the classroom to occupy a seat near the front. If his out of character behavior hadn’t caused people to glance at him a bit too often, Zorian would have probably overlooked him.\r\n\r\nHe was so shocked to see the boy finally present in class that he momentarily halted in his tracks, standing like an idiot in the middle of the classroom. Then, after a moment’s thought, he set off towards the likely cause of his predicament.\r\n\r\nHis first instinct was to immediately march up to the boy and drag him away into some forgotten corner to clear everything up, but Zach’s subdued appearance gave him pause. Zach’s skin was pale and bloodless, and he was breathing a little too quickly and shallowly for a healthy person. He looked sick. Thinking about it a little more carefully, approaching the boy so directly would be a reckless and possibly dangerous course of action. His loss to the lich aside, Zach was vastly more powerful than Zorian, and Zorian had no idea how the other boy would react if he knew there was another person tagging along in his time traveling adventure. He’d need to confront him sooner or later, though, so he fully intended to make at least tentative contact with the boy. He scanned the front of the classroom, looking for a free seat near Zach that would allow him to study the boy during the lecture.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t have to look hard – Zach was sitting very close to Briam, and every seat around Briam was empty. The cause was easy to divine: people were reluctant to get close to the angry-looking fire drake he was holding. As someone with future knowledge, Zorian knew their fears were well founded. While the young fire drake didn’t torch anyone (and sometimes Zorian wondered how much of that was thanks to the drake’s youth and lack of ability, as opposed to having self-restraint) it didn’t hesitate to bite and scratch, and it was hard to tell what would set it off. Fortunately, it seemed to tolerate Zorian better than most people, so he simply plopped down into the seat next to Briam, silencing the lizard’s hissing with an annoyed glare. He stared at the fire drake’s slitted yellow eyes until the reptile turned its head and left him alone.\r\n\r\n“Wow, you shut him down in an instant,” remarked Briam. “I wish I could control him that easily.”\r\n\r\nThe fire drake snapped its jaws at the air in front of Briam’s face, causing the boy to flinch back. Briam huffed in annoyance and apparently let the matter drop. Not for the first time, Zorian wondered just how smart that creature really was.\r\n\r\nThen, doing his best to appear natural, Zorian turned to Zach sitting a bit further away from him.\r\n\r\n“You look like hell,” Zorian remarked.\r\n\r\nZach groaned and buried his face into his hands. “I feel like hell,” he moaned. “What did that pile of bones do to me?”\r\n\r\nZorian’s heart quickened. Zach no doubt expected his comment to be disregarded as a weird metaphor, but to Zorian it was definite confirmation that Zach was also a time traveler. No points for guessing who or what the mysterious ‘pile of bones’ was.\r\n\r\nNow… how could he get Zach to talk more without revealing that he knew more than he should?\r\n\r\n“Pile of bones?” Zorian asked, his voice curious.\r\n\r\nZach opened his mouth to respond but Ilsa chose that exact moment to walk into the classroom and Zach dropped the issue.\r\n\r\nZorian had to restrain himself from glaring at Ilsa as she smiled at him. Couldn’t she have waited a few more minutes?\r\n\r\nIgnorant and uncaring of Zorian’s internal grumbling, Ilsa accepted the list of present students from Akoja and began introducing herself and her class. It wasn’t anything that Zorian hadn’t heard eight times already, so he mostly ignored her in favor of keeping an eye on Zach and plotting how to extract time travel related information out of him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he realized that Ilsa had stopped talking and was looking in his direction. After a few moments he realized she was looking at Zach.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Noveda, you look quite ill. Please tell me you didn’t come to my class with a hangover.”\r\n\r\nThe class erupted into laughter and Zach winced, either because loud noises bothered him in the state he was in or because he noticed the undercurrent of agitation in Ilsa’s question. Either way he recovered quickly.\r\n\r\n“It’s not a hangover,” protested Zach. “I just woke up like this, I swear.”\r\n\r\n“And you thought that coming to class like this was a good idea… why?” Ilsa prodded.\r\n\r\n“Err… I honestly didn’t think it would last this long. I figured it would pass in an hour or two,” said Zach sheepishly.\r\n\r\nZorian frowned. If the sickness was a consequence of the spell the lich had targeted them with that evening (and Zach certainly seemed to think so, if his previous comment was any indication), that would mean Zach had been suffering its effects for the past 8 months or so, as Zach had been absent for that long. Why would Zach expect a condition that serious to pass ‘in an hour or two’?\r\n\r\nWhy couldn’t there be any simple answers in all this?\r\n\r\n“Well it didn’t,” Ilsa concluded. “While I appreciate your dedication to your studies,” Zorian distinctly heard Ako snorting derisively in the background, “I must insist you go home or, better yet, visit a healer. You look like you’re going to collapse any moment.”\r\n\r\nBefore Zach could say anything, Zorian rose from his seat.\r\n\r\n“I’ll get him home, teacher,” he said. Zach gave him a surprised look, but Ilsa just nodded and shooed them away.\r\n\r\nZorian picked up his bag and left with Zach in tow, very pleased with himself. He got a legitimate excuse to talk to Zach in private and a permission to skip a class he had already attended 8 times by now. Could a victory be more complete?\r\n\r\n“You didn’t have to do that, you know?” Zach remarked, trailing behind him. “I can get back home on my own. I don’t feel that sick.”\r\n\r\n“But if I hadn’t done that, I would’ve had to sit through 2 hours of boring review,” countered Zorian.\r\n\r\nZach laughed, but his laughter quickly collapsed into a painful sounding cough.\r\n\r\n“Damn,” he wheezed. “He really did a number on me.”\r\n\r\n“Who is this someone you keep mentioning?” prodded Zorian.\r\n\r\n“It’s not important,” Zach mumbled. He took a deep breath and fixed Zorian with a speculative look. “Hey. Want to go to the cafeteria and grab something to eat?”\r\n\r\n“You think your stomach can handle it?” Zorian asked.\r\n\r\n“You bet,” Zach nodded. “I’m starving!”\r\n\r\nZorian shrugged and gestured for Zach to lead the way.\r\n\r\nThat was how Zorian found himself sharing a table with the cause of his time traveling problems, trying to think of a good opening for a conversation he wanted to have with the boy. Or should he wait for a few days to make Zach get used to his presence? Hmm…\r\n\r\n“You know, I find this whole situation very amusing,” Zach said between mouthfuls, shoveling noodles into his mouth and attempting to talk at the same time. Now that was very amusing. His mother always insisted he should aspire to behave ‘like a noble’. She would have a heart attack if he ever adopted Zach’s eating manners. “A good little student like you, skipping class to have lunch with a class delinquent… what is the world coming to? What would your mother say if she saw you now?”\r\n\r\n“First of all, I’m not skipping class – I’m escorting you home,” Zorian pointed out, ignoring a snort from Zach. “We just stopped for a meal so you wouldn’t collapse from starvation before we get there.” Another snort. “And my mother would go all sparkly-eyed at who I’m having lunch with and promptly forget I’m supposed to be in class.”\r\n\r\n“Ah. A social climber,” Zach said, a sour expression on his face. “Say no more. At least you’re male so she wouldn’t try to pair us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I do have a 9-year-old sister…”\r\n\r\n“Don’t go there,” Zach warned.\r\n\r\n“Fine,” agreed Zorian. He didn’t particularly want to continue in that avenue, anyway. “So are you going to tell me who roughed you up or what?”\r\n\r\n“You’re a lot nosier than I remember,” Zach huffed. “What makes you think someone roughed me up?”\r\n\r\n“Your offhand comments aren’t as oblique as you imagine them to be,” Zorian said.\r\n\r\n“Whatever,” Zach scoffed. “I just breathed in some weird fumes while I was messing with my alchemy set yesterday, that all.”\r\n\r\nAh, the trusty ‘alchemical accident’ excuse. So cliché, yet so effective. Zorian had used it quite a few times himself. In any case, he wasn’t willing to let go so easily. He decided to risk it and try to provoke a reaction from the boy.\r\n\r\n“Must have been some really weird fumes – the aftereffects almost look like soul magic exposure,” Zorian speculated loudly.\r\n\r\nZorian had expected some kind of reaction from Zach, but what he got was quite a bit stronger than what he had imagined. Zach immediately sat straighter in his seat, eyes wide in realization. “Of course! That’s why I’m still suffering the effects, even after the revert! The son of a bitch targeted the very thing that gets sent back – my soul!”\r\n\r\nThere was an eerie silence in the cafeteria as everyone stared at the crazy boy shouting nonsense in a crowded dining hall. Zach slowly lowered his hands (he had been gesticulating wildly during his little speech) and mumbled an apology that was too quiet for anyone but Zorian to hear. Scattered laughter rippled through the gathered students for a few moments before everything finally returned to normal.\r\n\r\n“Err…” started Zach. “Maybe we should continue this at the fountain, yeah?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” remarked Zorian carefully. “If you intend to be this loud, I don’t think it will do much.”\r\n\r\n“Oh ha ha,” grumbled Zach. “So I got a little excited... not everyone is an ice cube like you Zorian.”\r\n\r\n“Ice cube?” asked Zorian, an undercurrent of warning in his voice.\r\n\r\nBut Zach was already packing, and Zorian could do nothing but huff in annoyance and follow after him. Still, Zach’s little outburst answered a few of his questions. So it wasn’t his memories, or even his mind that got sent back – it was his soul. That would certainly explain why his spellwork and shaping skills didn’t disappear every time he started over. It was common knowledge that magic was heavily connected to the soul, even if no one really knew the exact mechanism of their interaction.\r\n\r\nWhen they finally reached the fountain, Zach seemed to be in a contemplative mood so Zorian took a moment to study the schools of colourful fish swimming in the basin of the fountain. He actually pitied the poor things, since they were unlikely to last long. For years the fountain had been in disrepair, and it was only due to the grander-than-usual summer festival that it was renovated. How likely was it that the Academy would continue to maintain it after the occasion passed? Not very. And it was even less likely it would be kept in a good enough condition for the fish to survive. Their days were numbered.\r\n\r\n“Zorian…” Zach prodded.\r\n\r\n“Hm?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me… what do you know about time travel?”\r\n\r\nZorian blinked. Well. That was direct.\r\n\r\n“Time travel?” Zorian asked with as much confusion as he could fake. “Not much, I guess. What’s that got to do with anything?”\r\n\r\n“Ugh, well…” Zach fumbled with words, scratching his chin nervously. “You’ll probably think I’m insane, but I’m a time traveler of sorts.”\r\n\r\nWow, Zach really didn’t have a subtle bone in his body, did he?\r\n\r\n“You don’t look very old,” Zorian remarked. “If you come from the future it must not be a very far one.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, it’s more like… the whole world resets itself on the night of the summer festival, and I’m the only one who remembers what happened.”\r\n\r\nThat was an interesting way of explaining it, though the idea of a spell affecting the whole world was even more ridiculous than the idea of working time travel magic.\r\n\r\n“I’ve lived through this month… god, at least 200 times by now,” continued Zach. “Honestly, I’m starting to lose count.”\r\n\r\n“Wait, you’re talking about it like you can’t stop it,” said Zorian, unable to keep a tiny bit of alarm out of his voice. Luckily, Zach appeared to be too agitated to notice.\r\n\r\n“That’s just it, I don’t know if I can stop it!” Zach shouted, before he realized what he was doing and quieted down so as to not attract unneeded attention. “I was hit by this spell in the previous revert, and its effects didn’t completely go away when I reverted into the past.”\r\n\r\nZorian frowned. ‘Previous revert’? What about the other 7? Did Zach somehow skip those or did he simply not remember them? It occurred to Zorian that the after-effects of the lich’s spell could have been even more serious than what he was currently looking at – what if Zach had spent the past 7 restarts in a coma? Though that begged the question of why his guardian had reported him as missing instead of bringing a healer.\r\n\r\n“I guess it really was a soul magic spell like you said,” continued Zach. “I need to watch out for those from now on. Anyway, at first I thought it’s just some nasty sickness that’ll pass, and to a degree I was right. I already feel a lot better than I did this morning. It’s just that it wasn’t only my body that was affected – my mind has been a little spotty ever since I woke up.”\r\n\r\nOh no…\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember how I started this time loop,” concluded Zach, confirming Zorian’s fears. “Or whether it was me who started it in the first place. My memory is full of blanks like that at the moment. I’m hoping it will all come back to me but…”\r\n\r\nZorian stared at the other boy, stony faced. Basically, they were both in deep shit.\r\n\r\nZach seemed to interpret Zorian’s serious look a little differently, though.\r\n\r\n“You don’t believe me,” he concluded.\r\n\r\n“It’s pretty far-fetched,” Zorian said. If he hadn’t lived through it, he wouldn’t have believed him, no. “But I’m a pretty open-minded guy. Let’s pretend you’re right for the moment. What’s that got to do with me?”\r\n\r\nZach arched an eyebrow at him, apparently incredulous about something.\r\n\r\n“Huh,” he said. “You’re really different from your other self.”\r\n\r\n“My other self?” Zorian asked curiously.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Zach nodded. “My memory may be spotty about some things, but I definitely remember you. Mostly because you kept dying at the start of the attack…”\r\n\r\nZach mumbled the last sentence in a quiet voice that probably wasn’t meant to carry but did. Zorian pretended he didn’t hear it.\r\n\r\n“You’re different than you used to be,” Zach said. “You were more irritable, and always busy with something or other. You never believed me when I tried to tell you about the whole time travel thing – you thought I was trying to make fun of you.”\r\n\r\nWell… that kind of story sounded exactly like something his brothers would try to fool him with. And Zach did have a great many things in common with those two already.\r\n\r\n“You’ve changed,” Zach concluded. “You’re a lot calmer. More laid-back, I guess.”\r\n\r\nZorian frowned. He didn’t think he changed that much in personality, but he supposed it would be hard to not change when going through something like this. To say nothing of the fact that more than 8 months had passed since the restarts started for Zorian.\r\n\r\n“So, wait… why did I change then?” Zorian asked. “Didn’t you say the whole world resets itself?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t know,” Zach shrugged, then gave him a speculative look. “Come to think of it, you were there too, weren’t you?”\r\n\r\nZorian gave him a confused look. He wasn’t going to get baited that easily.\r\n\r\n“No, of course you don’t remember,” Zach sighed. “Do you at least feel a little different lately or something?”\r\n\r\n“Come to think of it… yes,” confirmed Zorian. “I chose different electives than I intended to, for no good reason really, and I did a bunch of other strange things ever since I came to Cyoria.”\r\n\r\nZorian’s motivation for saying that was two-fold. First of all, he wanted to see how Zach would react to the idea of another person going through the time loop with him. Secondly, he wanted to lay the groundwork for an explanation why he’d be acting differently in every restart, in case he decided not to tell Zach about himself.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised that Zach was so willing to believe him, though. Apparently even after all this time (nearly 17 years, if the other boy was to be believed), Zach still hasn\'t developed an ability to effectively read people. That, or Zorian really was that good of an actor.\r\n\r\n“Strange,” was all Zach said.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Zorian agreed. “So… any advice a time traveler can tell a mortal like me? A secret spell of awesomeness, maybe?”\r\n\r\n“To be honest, most of the spells I know are combat ones,” Zach admitted. “I’m really good at combat magic, which is good because I need to be good at it. There is… something I’m trying to stop.”\r\n\r\n“Something involving the mysterious adversary that messed you up?” tried Zorian. He really wanted to work the invasion into the conversation but didn’t know how to justify knowing anything about it. “Do you remember how that happened, at least?”\r\n\r\n“Ugh,” grunted Zach. “Mostly. I distinctly remember you being there, but you probably died right at the start of the battle – no offense Zorian, but you aren’t much of a fighter – and then I stupidly charged in, thinking myself invulnerable.”\r\n\r\n“Why would you ever think that?” Zorian asked, honestly confused. “That you’re invulnerable, I mean. Doesn’t it strike you as dangerously arrogant to perceive yourself as invincible?”\r\n\r\n“Do you know how many times I’ve died in these reverts?” protested Zach. “My memory is failing me again, but it was a lot. You tend not to take it too seriously after a while. And it’s not like I was too far off – I just have to watch out for necromancy next time, right?”\r\n\r\n“Not just necromancy,” Zorian replied with a heavy sigh. “There is also mind magic to worry about. Aside from the obvious possibility of ending up as a mind thrall, you could also end up with more than a few gaps in your memory – you could have your whole mind blanked out. Then there is a possibility of having a geas forced upon you if you’re too careless, which also bind to the soul as far as I know. Some creatures, such as wraiths, eat souls – that’s another thing to worry about. And there are a couple of methods of sealing away a mage’s ability to do magic, which might very well stay with you when you… ‘revert’.”\r\n\r\nZach was silent, but Zorian could have sworn he had gotten even paler as he listened to Zorian speak.\r\n\r\n“And that’s just a couple of points off the top of my head,” finished Zorian. “I’m only an academy student, and I don’t know anything. It’s obvious w- err, you are not invulnerable. Okay?”\r\n\r\nZorian swallowed heavily. That was close. It was fortunate that Zach was so oblivious, because had the situation been reversed, he would have called Zach out on it ages ago.\r\n\r\n“Wow, you almost sound like you care,” Zach finally said with a nervous chuckle. “You really do believe I’m a time traveler now, huh?”\r\n\r\nZorian shrugged. “I’m not completely convinced, but it’s not something that’s worth fighting over in my opinion. If you say you’re a time traveler, then we’ll pretend you’re a time traveler.”\r\n\r\nYes. Until he got a better feel for Zach’s character and understood what the deal was with the time loop, he would pretend.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nWhen Zorian finally returned to school, having missed both the remainder of essential invocations and the following lecture about magical law, he was beset by curious classmates and Ako. Ako was easy to deal with, since she only wanted to scold him for taking too long and warn him she recorded his absence in the attendance record. Zorian was pretty sure the only person, teachers included, who cared about what was written on that list was Akoja. The ones that wanted to know what’s wrong with Zach were also easy. It was an alchemical accident.\r\n\r\nWhat? It’s the excuse Zach used!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many people also wanted to know why he had suddenly volunteered to take him home, or what had taken him so long. Nosy, nosy people. And they were persistent too, refusing to leave him alone for the rest of the day. When Zorian finally reached his room he immediately locked his door and breathed a sigh of relief. He finally had enough time to think about what he found out today.\r\n\r\nZach was confident he would be fine by tomorrow, and that his memory would come back to him. Zorian was not nearly as confident. That Zach had a 7-month gap in his memory (and possibly existence) suggested something very serious had been done to him. Why hadn’t Zorian suffered anything of the sort? Well… maybe he had. He had felt uncharacteristically tired in his first restart, but had written it off as mental stress. Maybe he had only been caught at the very edge of the spell and thus only suffered minor damage, or maybe his ‘first restart’ was only the first one he had memory of.\r\n\r\nIt was a disturbing possibility, but there was not much point in dwelling on it much.\r\n\r\nIt really wasn’t that unexpected, when you really thought about it. The strange time travel effect he and Zach were under had essentially turned them into soul entities. A lich was, at its core, also a soul entity. They were mages that ritually killed themselves and tethered their souls to an object – their phylactery – before it could move on into the afterlife. If the form they currently inhabited ever got destroyed, they’d snap back to their phylactery, and simply possess someone. It would make sense for a lich to know how to fight another lich. And a method that worked against a lich would work just as well against him and Zach.\r\n\r\nAnd Zach had stupidly said as much to the lich at the end of their battle! ‘It’s not like I’ll be dead for good,’ indeed! The lich may not have known what Zach was exactly, but a statement like that strongly suggested he was either a lich himself or some kind of a possessor entity, and from a practical standpoint it wasn’t that far off.\r\n\r\nBut that was all neither here nor there. The real question was: what was he going to do now? Even if Zach regained his memories (doubtful), he would no doubt want to keep the time loop going until he found a way to defeat the lich. If the boy’s previous altercation with the undead mage was of any indication, that could take a while. And that was assuming Zach was the originator of the spell in the first place. If it happened once, it could have happened twice. He had a sneaking suspicion that Zach might be as much of a stowaway as Zorian was. Was there a third looping person running around?\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he didn’t feel as desperate to get out of this thing as he was at the start of it. Getting out might not necessarily mean going back to normal. The invasion was clearly more than a random terrorist attack, and Zorian somehow doubted that stopping it would be the end of it. Something very big was happening, and Zorian was a very small fish. A roach, as Taiven would charmingly say. Inside the time loop, he had a chance to secure his future. Outside of it, he was just another victim.\r\n\r\nBesides, if Zach was to be believed, ‘normal’ for Zorian meant getting killed at the start of the invasion. He didn’t care much for that kind of ‘normal’. In fact, the more he thought about it the more it seemed to him this whole thing was a giant opportunity rather than an annoyance. Once upon a time, when Zorian was younger, he dreamt of being a great mage. The sort that legends were made of, the kind that revolutionized whole fields of magic all by themselves. In time this dream died as it became clear he didn’t have the talent, the work ethic, or the right connections to make that happen. He was just a slightly above average civilian-born student with no special advantages to his name. But now? He had all the time he needed to build up an advantage over his peers and become truly great. Greater than Daimen.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, abandoning that train of thought. He was getting ahead of himself. He needed something more concrete than a fuzzy notion of greatness to guide him – a clear set of goals to achieve, and courses of action to pursue. Right now, the only thing he could think of was harassing Zach for some tips, raiding the library for more spells, and leveraging his curious monetary situation to improve his alchemical skills.\r\n\r\nHe was leery about relying on Zach for help. Even if the boy would be cooperative, there was only so much he could learn from the other time traveler without revealing that he too retained his memories each time they reverted to the past.\r\n\r\nThe library was full of spells, of course, but anything ‘serious’ (that is, that could be used for combat, crime, or spying) was restricted, and he knew from talking to older students that teachers were really stingy with permission slips. Not even Fortov succeeded in getting one, and he could charm a troll into not eating him.\r\n\r\nHoning his alchemy skills was definitely an option. The only reason he focused more heavily on invocation thus far was because he had to buy any ingredients he wished to work with, and he was trying to save money. Any serious study of alchemy required a lot of funds – alchemical ingredients were expensive. With his saving account spontaneously refilling after each restart, however, monetary concerns didn’t limit him as much as they did before.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t much, to be honest. He needed a better plan. With another sigh, Zorian pulled out his trusty notebook and began to plot and write.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\n“Something I can do for you, sonny?” asked Kyron. “The class has been dismissed, in case you didn’t notice.”\r\n\r\n“Err, I noticed. I just wanted to talk to you about something,” Zorian said. Kyron gestured him to keep talking. “I hope you don’t find it insulting, but your stated program seems a bit… easy. Practicing magic missile for a whole month seems rather pointless to me, since I already have a pretty good grasp on it.”\r\n\r\nKyron stared at him for a few seconds. Zorian suppressed the instinct to shuffle nervously in place and returned the man’s stare. Kyron seemed like a sort of person who would be impressed by that.\r\n\r\n“I hope you don’t find it insulting, sonny, but you just don’t have enough power to be a proper battle mage,” Kyron finally said. “Your shaping skills are rather impressive for your age, but you tire after only 10 shots from the rod. And that just won’t do in any serious combat.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I kind of know that,” admitted Zorian. His reserves had increased slightly from what they were when he first tackled this class, so 10 shots was actually an improvement. “Incidentally, is there anything I can do about that?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing I would recommend,” Kyron said, shaking his head. “Your mana reserves will grow as your proficiency in magic grows, of course, but so will everyone else’s. You will always be at a disadvantage against naturally powerful opponents, which would be most of the professional battle mages. Of course, I cannot forbid you from pursuing a career as a battle mage, but I definitely advise you against it. There are plenty of magical disciplines where great shaping skills are an asset, but combat magic is mostly about power.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Zorian. He didn’t intend to become a battle mage, but he had a feeling he was going to need some combat magic, whether he liked it or not. At the very least he wanted to be able to deal with any stray winter wolves or trolls he might encounter during the invasion. “Though my point still stands. Since I can already do the spell well enough, and that’s the only thing you intend to instruct us in for the foreseeable future, I can see little point in attending the class for the foreseeable future.”\r\n\r\n“Hmph,” Kyron snorted. “Trying blackmail on me, sonny?”\r\n\r\n“Er…”\r\n\r\n“It’s fine, I don’t mind. And I do understand your point of view here…” Kyron rubbed his chin for a second, mulling something over in his head. “Wait here.”\r\n\r\n15 minutes later Kyron returned with another spell rod, a small booklet, and four ceramic plates. He threw the plates towards Zorian, who hastily caught them before they shattered upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“Good reflexes,” Kyron complimented. “They’re actually reinforced, so you don’t have to worry about dropping them too much.” He took one of the spell rods they used in class and grasped it firmly in his hand. “Let me demonstrate something to you. Throw one of the plates to my left.”\r\n\r\nZorian immediately complied, and Kyron wordlessly pointed the rod in the plate’s general direction and fired. He was wide of the mark, but the bolt of force actually homed in on the plate anyway, curving through the air to intercept it. The plate shattered into dust and sharp fragments.\r\n\r\n“Again,” Kyron snapped.\r\n\r\nZorian threw another plate, and another bolt of force sped towards it. This one was different, however – it was longer and thinner, like an oversized needle. It hit the plate, but instead of smashing it to pieces it went right through it, punching a hole through the center before dissipating.\r\n\r\n“Throw the last two together,” Kyron instructed.\r\n\r\nTwo plates flew into the air, and Kyron once again pointed the rod in their general direction. Zorian waited for the bolt of force, but none was forthcoming. Instead, both plates were suddenly cut in half by some unseen blades.\r\n\r\nKyron lowered his hand and began to speak.\r\n\r\n“The reason I’ll be spending so much time on magic missile is because it’s a very versatile spell,” Kyron spoke. “In its simplest form, it takes the form of a shining bolt of force that travels in a straight line, delivering concussive blasts of force to whatever it impacts. This variant is often called the smasher, and it is a very simple and effective spell. A skilled mage can do so much more with it, however. You can use animation magic to make it home in on a target. You can sharpen it into a point that will pierce things instead of batter them, or a line to cut them – the piercer and cutter, respectively. You can fire multiple missiles instead of one – a swarm, even, if you have the reserves and skill to pull it off. And, of course, you can make the projectile invisible.”\r\n\r\n“Invisible?” asked Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Kyron agreed. “A perfectly cast force spell is completely transparent. The lightshow you usually see is magical leakage resulting from an imperfect spell boundary. The speed with which combat magic is cast virtually guarantees that some mistakes in constructing the spell boundary will be made, and even if no mistakes are made the large amounts of mana pumped into the constructs can easily distort or unravel some of the pieces.”\r\n\r\n“So I’m messing the spell up?” summarized Zorian, thinking of the brightly shining projectiles he always got when he used the rod. “Wait, your missiles normally shine too. Is that-“\r\n\r\nKyron chuckled. “Like I said at the start – there are plenty of magical disciplines where great shaping skills are an asset, but combat magic is mostly about power. Most battle mages can’t even make a simple magic missile transparent, much less one of the higher level force spells. It doesn’t hold them back any. Even I usually don’t bother, since the benefits are so marginal. You, on the other hand, need every advantage you can get.”\r\n\r\nKyron pushed the spell rod and the accompanying booklet into Zorian’s hands.\r\n\r\n“You are right that you won’t learn much in class in the next month or so. The smasher may be simple, but more than half of your classmates are having trouble with it as it is, and you’re the only one that truly has a good grasp on it. So read the booklet, find some targets to practice on, and make sure there is a friend nearby while you practice to get help if you screw up big. Oh, and don’t hurt anyone with the rod I’m loaning you or I’ll be mad. Come back to me in two weeks so I can see how you’re progressing.”\r\n\r\n“Right,” agreed Zorian enthusiastically. This went a lot better than he thought it would.\r\n\r\n“Now get lost,” Kyron gestured towards the door. “You’ve wasted my entire coffee break already.”\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nZorian dropped the stack of books on a nearby table and surveyed the shelves. He had decided to try his luck as a library employee again, hoping he would find a way to get around spell restrictions as an employee. Zach had been absent from class for a couple of days at this point, probably still suffering from the aftereffects of the soul spell, so he couldn’t simply trick the answer out of his fellow time traveler. And besides, he wanted to learn those book divinations he was promised before being brutally murdered, and all.\r\n\r\nHe wasn’t in a hurry to get Kirithishli to teach him those divination spells, though – the magic missile variations Kyron gave him to practice were giving him enough problems as it was. Like Kyron had said at the beginning of the lecture, the problem was that shaping had to be done in an instant and involved shoving a great deal of his mana reserves into a hastily constructed spell boundary. That was easy enough when you just wanted a bolt that traveled in a straight line and smashed things, but trying to weave, say, a homing function into the spell was a chore to do in a fraction of a second. To say nothing of trying to eliminate all the little imperfections and make the bolt transparent.\r\n\r\nWhich is not to say he made no progress! He could make the bolt curve towards a target even if his aim was a little off, and he managed to make a flawless piercer yesterday. Progress!\r\n\r\n“You’re pretty good at this stuff,” Ibery remarked beside him, putting a book on the shelf. “I’m surprised. Usually it takes a while for people to really understand the system we use here. I guess you worked in a library before, huh?”\r\n\r\n“Uh, yeah,” agreed Zorian. It was technically true. “It was… surprisingly similar to this one in organization.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not really surprising,” Kirithishli said behind him, causing him to jump in surprise. “All state libraries use the same organizing system. It’s a standard enforced by the Society of Librarians. Hell, even the systems of other Splinter Nations are pretty similar.”\r\n\r\n“Because they all used to be part the same country?” guessed Zorian.\r\n\r\n“It is debatable whether or not the Old Alliance could be considered a unified state,” Kirithishli said. “The name says it all, really – it was an alliance more than anything. Arguably it was the attempt to turn it into a state that led to the Splinter Wars. But yes, being once part of the Old Alliance, the Splinter Nations inherited much of its administrative legacy, including library organization.”\r\n\r\nZorian was starting to understand why Kirithishli had such strained relations with the current headmaster. He knew very little about the man, but what he did suggested he was very politically involved and… well, patriotic. And the country they were living in made its official position clear – there was no ‘Old Alliance’, because the Alliance of Eldemar never ended. It simply shrank. That this was a completely ridiculous claim was self-evident to citizens domestic and foreigner alike, but most found it easier to humor the politicians. Kirithishli apparently went a step further and denied there was a predecessor state to be an inheritor of in the first place. A fiery, opinionated woman that she was, she probably said something of the sort within the headmaster’s earshot. That must have been a fun conversation.\r\n\r\n“Hey!” called a familiar voice. “Is Zorian here? I heard-“\r\n\r\n“Don’t shout in the library, Zach,” Zorian sighed. “Since you’re back to your usual exuberance, I’m guessing you’re alright now?”\r\n\r\n“Yup!” Zach said happily, thumping his chest a few times. “Healthy like an oak. Got an hour to grab something to eat?”\r\n\r\n“In case you haven’t noticed, I’m working at the moment,” Zorian protested.\r\n\r\n“It’s not an issue, Zorian, we’re mostly done for the day,” Kirithishli pointed out. Then she leaned towards him and whispered into his ear. “Unless you wanted to get rid of him and I’m interfering?”\r\n\r\nZorian waved her concerns away and followed Zach outside. As amusing as it would be to see what Kirithishli would say to Zach to get rid of him, he actually wanted to talk to the boy.\r\n\r\n“So how come you sought me out?” Zorian asked. He thought he’d have to hound the boy to get more information, but it seemed Zach had taken a liking to him. He didn’t know whether to be pleased or annoyed by that. It was convenient, but it increased the chances that he’d realize something was off with Zorian.\r\n\r\n“You’re the most interesting person I know of at the moment, and the only other person who believes me about time travel except Neolu,” Zach said.\r\n\r\n“Neolu?” asked Zorian incredulously.\r\n\r\n“She’s an avid reader of speculative fiction and mysteries and is very imaginative and open-minded,” said Zach. “A naïve dreamer, her father would say. It was surprisingly easy to convince her I’m really a time traveler. I guess she wants to believe it’s true.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Zorian. He supposed that he knew now why Zach involved Neolu so much the first time he went through this month. He still didn’t know who the other girl was, though, and didn’t know how he might work her into the conversation. “How many people did you try to convince, anyway?” asked Zorian.\r\n\r\n“All of our classmates and teachers, the headmaster, and the heads of every police department in the city. A couple of nobles and other influential people.”\r\n\r\nHow… persistent.\r\n\r\n“Not very successful, I imagine,” Zorian guessed.\r\n\r\n“That’s putting it mildly,” Zach sighed.\r\n\r\nZorian frowned, suddenly realizing something. Why did Zach try to convince all those people he was a time traveler? That didn’t sound like something a time traveler that came specifically to stop the invasion would do. It sounded more like something Zorian briefly considered when he realized how utterly over the head he was, but ultimately decided to scrap the idea because he expected the results to be more or less identical to what Zach got.\r\n\r\n“Zach,” began Zorian carefully, “what about those gaps in your memory? Are they…”\r\n\r\n“They’re still there,” Zach scowled. “I’m pretty sure they’re not increasing anymore though, thank the gods.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm,” agreed Zorian. “So you don’t know how you achieved this time travel magic, then? I looked it up, and it’s supposed to be impossible, you know? As impossible as drawing a square triangle, in fact.”\r\n\r\n“Well it’s clearly not that impossible, is it?” Zach countered. “But no, I have no idea how I did that. If I did that.”\r\n\r\n“If you did that,” agreed Zorian. “From your comments I’m getting a feeling you started these reverts as a common academy student. And I mean no offense, but the Zach I remember wasn’t really the kind of person capable of inventing any spell, much less something as concept-breaking as time travel.”\r\n\r\n“Eh heh…” Zach chuckled nervously. “You’re probably right. I used to be really bad at this whole mage business, didn’t I? But enough of such depressing topics, because I’ve got good news for you!”\r\n\r\n“Oh?” Zorian asked curiously.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Zach confirmed. “I heard you’ve been trying to learn combat magic.”\r\n\r\n“Eh!? Where did you hear that?” protested Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Kyron told the rest of the teachers, the teachers told the administrative staff, the administrative staff told the janitors and other low paying workers, they told the students, and the students told me,” finished Zach. “What does it matter? What matters is that I’m very good at combat magic thanks to the reverts, and that I’ve decided to teach you. Think of it as a reward for believing me.”\r\n\r\nZorian gave Zach an incredulous look. He was going to help him out on his own free will? Just like that? No need for any plotting or subtle maneuvering?\r\n\r\nAlmost disappointing.\r\n\r\n“What?” Zach protested. “It’s true, I really am good at combat magic! In fact, that’s the field I’m most talented at!”\r\n\r\nOh, now that’s a wonderful opening…\r\n\r\n“Not that I don’t believe you, but how exactly did you get so good at combat magic?” asked Zorian. “I mean, mages are really stingy about sharing combat magic. Even with these… reverts… why would they share them with an academy student like you? Especially since you’re… uh…”\r\n\r\n“Known to be irresponsible,” Zach finished for him. “To be honest, I didn’t get the spells I know legally. I wouldn’t recommend my methods of acquiring combat magic to anyone who isn’t a time traveler. You tend to die a lot.”\r\n\r\n“Oh.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. But you have me, so there’s that.”\r\n\r\nQuietly wondering what he was getting himself into, Zorian followed after him.'),

('Perspective', 'Mother of Learning', 8, '“Here we are!” said Zach happily, twirling around with his hands outstretched. “What do you think?”\r\n\r\nZorian studied the meadow in front of him, his eyes darting back and forth with suspicion. At first glance the area was just a large patch of grass surrounded by a ring of trees, but Zorian couldn’t help but notice signs of obvious neglect. The grass was too wild and tall, and the space between trees was full of young saplings fighting for their own place under the sun. It was a good place to practice combat magic at, but also a good place to hide a body in. In an even remotely normal situation, Zorian wouldn’t be caught dead following a complete stranger into a creepy, isolated place like this one. Oh how far his perspective had shifted…\r\n\r\n“I wonder what’s keeping the saplings confined to that ring of trees,” wondered Zorian aloud. “This meadow should be a copse of trees by now.”\r\n\r\nZach blinked. “I never thought about that,” he admitted. “You notice the strangest things, Zorian.”\r\n\r\n“I also wonder how a place like this can exist at all,” Zorian continued. “I mean, we’re in Cyoria. Land is very expensive here. Why is someone letting this place deteriorate like this instead of selling it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s easy,” Zach said. “It’s my land. Or rather, it’s part of the Noveda family estates. It’s supposed to be a private garden for the Head of House, or something like that, so no one could do anything with it unless they had my explicit permission. But since I hadn’t even known this place existed before the reverts… yeah.”\r\n\r\n“Hm,” Zorian agreed. “I guess I should have expected something like that. Your home is pretty close from here, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“You know where I live?” Zach asked, surprise evident in his voice.\r\n\r\nCrap. What to say, what to say…\r\n\r\n“Of course I know where you live,” Zorian said, looking at Zach like the boy was an idiot for asking. “Who doesn’t know where the Noveda estate is located?”\r\n\r\nA lot of people, probably. Zorian himself certainly hadn’t known, not until he tried to track Zach down in one of the restarts.\r\n\r\n“Heh. I’m pretty famous, aren’t I?” Zach said, grinning widely.\r\n\r\nNote to self: Zach is easy to distract by appealing to his pride.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, yeah,” sighed Zorian. “So is the great Noveda going to help me learn combat magic like he promised or not? Daylight’s burning.”\r\n\r\nZach snapped his fingers, apparently remembering just why they came here in the first place. His hands blurred into a sequence of gestures, and several humanoids made of earth rose from the ground on the other side of the clearing.\r\n\r\nZorian gaped. Now that was impressive. Zach didn’t even have to chant anything to cast that spell, and he went through the gestures with such speed Zorian had trouble remembering what they even were. Plus, those earthen constructs weren’t just immobile statues – they moved. It was in times like this that Zorian remembered he was dealing with a vastly superior mage that had him beat in virtually every conceivable way. It was humbling, to say the least.\r\n\r\n“Wow,” he said out loud.\r\n\r\n“It’s not as impressive as it looks,” Zach said. “They’re nearly useless in actual battle. They make good targets though, since they’re pretty resilient and reform each time you mess them up.”\r\n\r\nZach fired a quick magic missile at one of the statues to demonstrate, hitting it square in the chest. The earthen construct took a step back from the force of the bolt, and a web of cracks erupted from the impact point, but the cracks quickly sealed themselves shut and the construct otherwise completely ignored the attack.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe this,” Zorian stated incredulously.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” Zach asked. “They’re just animated earth so it’s-”\r\n\r\n“Not them,” Zorian protested. “The magic missile! No chant, no gestures, no spell formula, no nothing! You just pointed your finger at the target and produced a magic missile!”\r\n\r\nWhich, admittedly, was a gesture. Not one that should be sufficient to produce a magic missile, though.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that,” Zach said, waving his hand dismissively. “That’s not terribly special either. That’s just reflexive magic. When you cast a spell enough times-“\r\n\r\n“Mana shaping becomes instinctive and you can start leaving out spell components,” finished Zorian for him. Any serious mage had at least a couple of spells they knew so intimately they could leave out a couple of words and gestures and still get it working. “But getting a spell to work with something as simple as pointing a finger would take years!”\r\n\r\nZach simply grinned from ear to ear.\r\n\r\n“Which, uh, I guess you had,” Zorian concluded, feeling rather stupid. “This time travel thing is really convenient, isn’t it? How many reflexive spells do you have, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“You mean, how many are as reflexive as the magic missile I just showed you? Shield, hurl, recall, flamethrower, and a couple of other easy combat spells. There are a lot of spells I’m familiar with, but I can’t exactly throw fireballs by pointing my fingers.”\r\n\r\n“Right,” said Zorian sourly. He was getting way past ‘humbling’ and straight into ‘feeling mightily inadequate’ territory. Better steer the conversation back to the lesson before Zach completely demoralized him. “So where do we start?”\r\n\r\n“Kyron gave you a spell rod and told you to practice magic missile, didn’t he?” asked Zach.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” confirmed Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s see how that’s working out for you first,” said Zach, waving his hand in the direction of the earthen constructs. “Fire a couple of missiles at the mud people.”\r\n\r\n“Mud people?” asked Zorian incredulously. “Is that-“\r\n\r\n“Probably not,” Zach admitted. “I kind of forgot the official name of the spell, so I just refer to it as ‘Create Mud People’. It doesn’t matter all that much since the spell is obscure and obsolete, and virtually no one except me uses it.”\r\n\r\n“I guess,” agreed Zorian. He was tempted to ask more, but figured he would never get to actual spell practice if he kept distracting Zach with his questions. He pointed the spell rod Kyron gave him at the closest… ‘mud person’… and fired. He was a bit surprised when the construct tried to side-step his magic missile instead of soaking the spell like it did when Zach targeted it, but that didn’t save it – he had enough control of the spell to alter the missile’s flight path accordingly, even if he couldn’t get the bolt to home in on the target on its own. Of course, the bolt did very little actual damage to the construct, and even that repaired itself quickly. Undeterred, Zorian kept firing. His next shot was a piercer aimed at the head of the construct, which succeeded in hitting it squarely in the forehead but failed to actually punch through the animated earth. He tried to shape the next bolt into a cutter, but all he got was a diffuse blob of multicolored light that popped like a soap bubble half-way to the target. The next two were regular smashers, one of which missed when its target leaned to the side at the last moment before the bolt hit him.\r\n\r\nZorian stopped at this point, not wanting to completely deplete his mana reserves. He demonstrated pretty much everything he achieved so far, anyway.\r\n\r\nZach clapped overdramatically, completely ignoring the mild glare Zorian sent his way.\r\n\r\n“You’ve only been practicing, what, for a couple of days?” asked Zach. Zorian nodded. “And you can direct your bolts already? You’re a lot better than I thought you’d be.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?” asked Zorian, a hint of warning in his voice. “And why is that?”\r\n\r\n“Let me ask you this instead: how many magic missiles can you cast before you run out of mana?” asked Zach.\r\n\r\n“10,” answered Zorian. He didn’t see what that… oh. “Ah. Normally learning time corresponds to mana capacity, doesn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Yup! The bigger your mana reserves, the longer you can train each day,” confirmed Zach. “It means mages with larger reserves tend to learn faster than their less gifted compatriots.”\r\n\r\n“Assuming everyone is equally dedicated and equally good at shaping mana,” noted Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Assuming that,” agreed Zach. “Though the difference in mana reserves tends to overshadow almost everything else. Do you know how many magic missiles I can cast before I run out of mana?”\r\n\r\nZorian hadn’t forgotten Zach’s seemingly inexhaustible mana reserves that he demonstrated during the invasion, and was aware that the number must be pretty high. Still, there was a limit to how big your mana reserves could get. The booklet Kyron gave him said average mages can fire somewhere between 8 to 12 magic missiles before running out of mana, while very gifted ones could manage as much as 20 or 30. Furthermore, while mana reserves increased with age and practice, they were not unlimited in potential – most people’s maximum was roughly 4 times the amount of mana reserves they started with, and usually less. Assuming Zach was in the above average range (something his comments and attitude strongly suggested), and that he achieved his maximum due to the time loop…\r\n\r\n“50?” he tried.\r\n\r\n“232,” said Zach smugly.\r\n\r\nZorian almost dropped the spell rod in shock, but in the end settled for staring at Zach like he just swallowed a live chicken. 232? What the hell!?\r\n\r\n“Admittedly I’m at the extreme high end when it comes to mana reserves,” Zach said. Understatement of the century! “And unlike you, I’ve spent years building them up, so they’re as high as they’re ever going to be. Still, even if you had a lifetime of practice, you’d probably never go over 40. That would make my reserves almost 6 times larger than yours. Quite a disadvantage to make up for.”\r\n\r\n“No kidding,” agreed Zorian. “I’m guessing that’s where you come in. Unless you’ve brought me here just to tell me how much I suck compared to you?”\r\n\r\n“Hah! I admit the look on your face when you realized how awesome I am was absolutely priceless, but that’s just a bonus,” said Zach.\r\n\r\nHe beckoned for Zorian to come closer and Zorian complied, allowing Zach to cast a completely unfamiliar spell on him.\r\n\r\nZorian felt the spell seep into his eyes, foreign mana straining against the innate magical resistance possessed by every living creature, and briefly considered snuffing the spell out before it took root. Not because he thought the spell was harmful, mind you, but out of principle. Zach just cast a spell on him without asking for permission or explaining what the spell did, which was a major breach of magical etiquette no matter how you looked at it. In the end he decided not to be that spiteful and simply reeled in his magical resistance, allowing the spell to do its work unopposed.\r\n\r\n“You already have control over your magical resistance?” asked Zach. “Sweet! I usually have to teach people how to do that, first. Hell, I didn’t know how to do that before the reverts.”\r\n\r\nZorian frowned, ignoring Zach’s comments in favor of trying to figure out what the spell actually did. It was concentrated in his eyes, so he should… see…\r\n\r\nOh.\r\n\r\nA glowing, mind-bogglingly huge pillar rose into the sky, warping and undulating like a living being, occasionally spawning short-lived whorls of glowing matter along its length. It only took Zorian a moment to realize what he was looking at.\r\n\r\n“That’s how the Hole looks like under mage sight?” he asked, focusing back on Zach.\r\n\r\n“Magnificent, isn’t it?” Zach said. “Watching that huge geyser of mana rising into the sky always puts things into perspective for me.”\r\n\r\n“Mage sight shouldn’t work in Cyoria, though,” remarked Zorian. “Too much ambient mana saturating everything. Why aren’t I blinded by painful glow emanating from everything in sight?”\r\n\r\n“It’s an experimental variation that tries to filter out such ‘noise’, showing only the important stuff,” said Zach. “It’s not terribly reliable, but it will do for our purposes.”\r\n\r\n“Those being?” asked Zorian.\r\n\r\n“I’ll cast magic missile repeatedly and you’ll watch what I’m doing for a while before trying to copy me,” Zach said. “I’ll be using the proper invocation this time, and go at it as slowly as I can. Try to memorize the words and gestures, because you’ll be using them instead of the rod Kyron gave you. A spell rod is more useful in combat, but for training purposes it’s better to work with actual invocations.”\r\n\r\nZorian was completely on board with the idea – he had been trying to find invocations for combat spells for a while now, anyway. Zach was underestimating him, though. ‘Try’ to memorize? Zorian might not have Zach’s absurd mana reserves, but his memory was quite good. It took only one proper casting from Zach and Zorian had already burned the casting procedure into his memory.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the rest of the session was a lot less impressive. Zach kept performing the spell a few more times before instructing Zorian to give it a try, upon which he found out that performing combat magic with classical invocations wasn’t only slower than using a spell rod – it was a lot harder too. Thankfully, the fact that he actually saw how the mana was supposed to be shaped during Zach’s demonstration drastically improved his learning speed, so he managed to fire off a passable magic missile in the end. He was completely out of mana by then, however, and Zach decided that was a good time to stop for the day.\r\n\r\nWalking back to his apartment, Zorian was lost in thought. Zach’s comment about the giant pillar of mana putting things into perspective for him seemed oddly applicable to his situation as well. Time loop or not, he would never beat Zach and people like him at their own game. Clearly Zorian couldn’t bulldoze his way through with combat magic, like Zach intended to do. No, if he was going to get out of this in a favorable manner, he had to forge his own path.\r\n\r\nIf only he knew what that path was, though. At the moment, getting to the bottom of what caused this time loop and how the damn thing worked seemed to be just about the only thing he could do to help himself. Which was unfortunate, because he just didn’t have the skills to unravel the mystery. Apparently he had to spend some time improving his magical abilities. Time, at least, he had in spades. Probably. He could never be sure the time loop would continue happening, but Zach certainly didn’t behave like it would end any time soon, and Zorian decided to follow Zach’s lead in that regard.\r\n\r\nHe really wished he had someone other than Zach to ask for advice on how to proceed in his quest to improve himself. Typically, this was what a student’s mentor was for, but he already knew what Xvim would tell him: more shaping exercises. Then he’d throw marbles at him.\r\n\r\nAlthough… Ilsa did offer to take over his mentorship in a couple of restarts, didn’t she? Hmm.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nDespite his desire for some additional help, Zorian delayed approaching Ilsa until he actually had a few sessions with Xvim. That would require a lengthy wait, but it would make it easier to complain about Xvim’s mentoring methods, since he wouldn’t have to explain how he knew so much about the man already. It wasn’t like he didn’t have anything to amuse himself in the meantime – Zach was, if anything, even more enthusiastic about their combat magic practice sessions than Zorian was, insisting they meet up every day after classes. After two weeks of such practice, Zorian was not only able to weave a proper homing function into the magic missile spell, but also learned how to cast shield and flamethrower spells as well. He was keenly aware that his ability to cast such spells would amount to exactly zero against a human battlemage, but he also knew they weren’t the only threats he faced. Those spells might buy him a second or two against a winter wolf or a troll, which could be the difference between life and death.\r\n\r\nZach returned to classes the day after their first practice session, apparently completely recovered. For a guy that lost a good chunk of his memory, he was surprisingly exuberant. Zorian admired his fellow time traveler for his ability to maintain good cheer in poor circumstances, but Zach’s attention grabbing behavior only made his inexplicable improvement in skill that much more noticeable. It was almost a repeat of the very first time he lived through this month, only instead of hanging out with Neolu and that other mystery girl, Zach was hanging out with him. Which, of course, made Zorian a target for every curious classmate that wanted to know how Zach suddenly got so good all of a sudden.\r\n\r\n“What am I supposed to tell them?” he asked Zach. They were both in the cafeteria, and he had noticed a couple of students glancing at him a bit too often, doubtlessly waiting for the chance to talk to him when Zach left. “I can’t exactly tell them you’re a time traveler.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” Zach asked. “Time travel. It’s what I say every time they ask me how I got this good.”\r\n\r\n“You actually tell them you’re a time traveler?” asked Zorian incredulously. He didn’t know whether to laugh or bang his head against the table.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” confirmed Zach. “What’s the worst that could happen?”\r\n\r\nZorian felt a pang of phantom pain in his chest where, in another timeline, a masked assassin stabbed him through and killed him. Did Zach honestly never experience consequences like that when trying to convince people of his story? Then again, he said he tried to convince them he was a time traveler, not that he told them about the invasion. In fact, he didn’t actually tell Zorian about that either – he danced around the topic whenever Zorian tried to lead the conversation in that particular direction.\r\n\r\n“This could have all been avoided if you just held back a little in classes,” Zorian sighed.\r\n\r\n“I kind of like the attention,” Zach admitted.\r\n\r\n“Really?” asked Zorian. “I’m only going through this once and I’m already sick of it. You’re saying the novelty of all that attention still hasn’t worn off after, what, more than a decade?”\r\n\r\n“Oh come on, do you really think I spend these reverts attending classes, of all things?” scoffed Zach. “That got seriously old after the third revert or so. I spend most of the time doing my own thing. Hell, usually I’m not even near Cyoria! I only attend the classes when I want to relax or when I am feeling nostalgic. The only reason why I’m here right now is because I got kind of roughed up in my last revert and I’m still trying to sort out the holes in my memory. Oh, and because you’ve kind of caught my interest.”\r\n\r\n“Why did I catch your interest, though?” asked Zorian. “Not that I’m complaining or anything, but how come you’re willing to invest so much time in me? Isn’t it all going to be useless in the next revert?”\r\n\r\n“That’s a pretty cold way of thinking about things,” Zach said. “I don’t really think like that. I’ve tried to get to know all of our classmates in these reverts, even though some of them were pretty uncooperative with the idea, and I’ve never thought of it as a waste of time. This is the first time I’ve gotten you this friendly, and I have no idea what exactly I did to cause that. It’s best to make use of it while I can.”\r\n\r\nNow he was starting to feel pretty bad. Not only had he never tried to get to know any of his classmates during the reverts, the idea had never even occurred to him. And this wasn’t the first time Zach had insinuated that Zorian was kind of a jerk to him in the past. Just what had happened between Zach and past-Zorian to leave that much of an impression?\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Zorian uncertainly, not knowing how to respond to that.\r\n\r\n“I really do wonder about you, though,” Zach continued. “You’re so different from the Zorian I knew, I’m starting to wonder if you’re really the same person.”\r\n\r\n“Who else would I be?” asked Zorian, honestly at a loss as to where Zach was going with this. He didn’t appear to have figured out that Zorian was ‘reverting’, as he would say, so what was he getting at?\r\n\r\n“I think I may have shifted timelines, or something,” Zach said.\r\n\r\nZorian gave him an incredulous look. Shifted timelines? That’s his explanation? Really? Really really? He almost revealed himself right then and there, just so he could tell him how silly that was. Almost.\r\n\r\n“Or something,” deadpanned Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Whaaat?” protested Zach. “It could happen. Do you know how temporal mechanics work? No? Didn’t think so.”\r\n\r\n“I did look up a couple of books about time travel after our first meeting,” said Zorian. It was a lie, of course, but only a small one – he had sifted through time travel related texts, just not in this particular restart.\r\n\r\n“And learned nothing,” concluded Zach. “It’s a total wasteland. All they write about is about various ethical dilemmas and time paradoxes and whatnot. That was the first and last time I set foot in the academy library, let me tell you.”\r\n\r\nZorian gave him a strange look. “That was a joke, right?”\r\n\r\n“Which part?” Zach asked.\r\n\r\n“The part where you only visited the academy library once,” clarified Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Err, well…” tried Zach, chuckling nervously. “What can I say? I don’t really like to read…”\r\n\r\nZorian stared at Zach, wondering if the boy was pulling his leg. He would totally understand if the old Zach, the one he knew before the time loop, told him he never set foot in the library. He wouldn’t be terribly unique in that regard – lots of students never visited the library before their third year, since they couldn’t access the spell repository before their certification, anyway. But this Zach had lived through this month over 200 times, and had access to the spells buried within its depths. And he never tried to search through it. Because he didn’t like to read.\r\n\r\nThe mind boggled. Well, Zorian’s mind boggled.\r\n\r\n“You’ve clearly read our textbooks,” Zorian noted. “There’s no way you’d excel as well as you do otherwise.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, well, I didn’t say I don’t read at all,” Zach countered. “Just that I’d rather avoid it if I can. I learn much better by example anyway.”\r\n\r\nFunny, it was just the opposite with Zorian – he tended to learn much better when he had the chance to study the topic on his own before trying. He still thought it was a pretty serious flaw for a mage to avoid books, but Zorian had to remind himself that Zach was clearly achieving results somehow. Come to think of it, there was a serious shortage of anything dangerous in the academy spell collection, so a mage that was chiefly interested in the more restricted areas of magic would find the library of very limited usefulness.\r\n\r\n“So you learn primarily by mentorship?” guessed Zorian. “I’m surprised you can convince mages to teach you in less than a month. Don’t they all require apprenticeships lasting for several years before they’ll agree to teach you anything useful?”\r\n\r\n“Well, usually,” said Zach. “But I’m the last Noveda, don’t you know? I had highly respectable mages tripping over themselves to teach me my whole life. Usually I just have to show up and tell them who I am and they’re all too happy to help me out.”\r\n\r\nZorian suppressed a wave of jealousy that washed over him. Zach was just making the most of his unique situation, just like Zorian would have in his place. It still bothered him, though, reminding him of how Daimen and Fortov could ask and get all sorts of help and concessions from their teachers, only for Zorian to fail in securing the same for himself. His parents had lectured him endlessly that the difference was in their attitudes – that if only Zorian was more sociable, more polite, more everything… he too could enjoy the same benefits. To Zorian, it always seemed like his brothers had some sort of invisible tattoo on their foreheads that only mages could see, and which marked them as somehow more special than him.\r\n\r\nZach wasn’t his brothers, though, and didn’t deserve to be the target for Zorian’s personal frustrations.\r\n\r\n“Convenient,” said Zorian out loud, giving his fellow time traveler a smile that was somewhat forced. Zach didn’t appear to notice.\r\n\r\nHis jealousy aside, he was really starting to wonder if his assumption about Zach being an accidental stowaway like him had any merit at all. Zach had ridiculously huge mana reserves, probably the largest of any student currently attending the academy. He was the last member of a famous Noble House, enjoying all the prestige that comes from that without having to deal with nosy parents who might be freaked out by Zach’s sudden transformation. In addition to the power inherent in his name, the boy was also fairly charming and outgoing, further improving his chances of getting help from otherwise unapproachable high-circle mages. He was not your average spoiled prince, by any means – there was a lot of potential in the boy, if only he would get enough time to bring it out. Time that Zach now had. It was… convenient. A bit too convenient, in Zorian’s opinion.\r\n\r\nThat is why, despite Zach’s seeming friendliness, Zorian just didn’t feel at ease with the boy. Not enough to reveal himself as a stowaway, in any case. Right now, his main advantage was that he was an outside element in this game Zach was playing. An unaccounted variable. He intended to use and abuse that advantage for all it was worth.\r\n\r\nWhatever force was behind Zach, Zorian had no intention of revealing himself to it any time soon.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\n“Take a seat, mister Kazinski,” Ilsa said. “I sort of suspected I’d be seeing you soon.”\r\n\r\n“You did?” asked Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” Ilsa said. “Usually students come knocking at my door immediately after a single session with Xvim. You actually waited until the second one, so points for patience.”\r\n\r\n“Right,” said Zorian sourly.\r\n\r\n“I can’t transfer you to another mentor at this time, though, so I’m afraid you’ll just have to bear with him for now,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I sort of expected that,” Zorian said. Why should her answer be any different than it was the last time he asked her? “It’s not what I’m here for.”\r\n\r\n“No?” asked Ilsa, raising an eyebrow.\r\n\r\n“No,” confirmed Zorian. “Since everything I’ve heard and experienced about Xvim suggests we’ll never progress beyond the basic three, I’ve decided to be proactive about self study. I’ve been hoping for some pointers from you – where I should start, what I should watch out for, that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nIlsa sighed heavily. “It’s hard to give that sort of advice, mister Kazinski. That’s why the academy gives students mentors – because there is no one-size-fits-all solution. I suppose I could give you advice about my own subject, though. How good are you at the basic three?”\r\n\r\n“Depends who you ask,” said Zorian. “Most of the teachers from my second year told me I had them mastered. Xvim says I’m a shame to mages everywhere.”\r\n\r\nShe snorted and handed him a pen. Actually handed it to him, not threw it at him like Xvim would have. Ah, the joy of interacting with sane teachers…\r\n\r\n“Levitate that,” Ilsa said.\r\n\r\nShe wasn’t even finished talking and the pen was already spinning above his outstretched palm.\r\n\r\n“Oh, so you can already spin the levitated object?” Ilsa said, sounding pleased. “I bet Xvim was very happy with that.” No, not really. “Do you know any other variation?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Zorian. “Don’t tell me learning those is standard procedure?”\r\n\r\n“Not like Xvim is teaching them,” Ilsa said. “But yes, most mentors will give students variations of the basic three to improve their shaping skills.”\r\n\r\n“And how many of those variations are there?” asked Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thousands,” said Ilsa, confirming Zorian’s suspicions. “But most students only learn 6 or so by the end of their third year. Here.”\r\n\r\nShe pushed a rather heavy book into his hands, patiently waiting for him to leaf through it. It was apparently a book describing 15 ‘particularly interesting’ variations of the basic three, 5 for each exercise.\r\n\r\n“Let me guess: you want me to learn everything inside this book,” Zorian sighed.\r\n\r\n“That would be a pretty neat trick,” Ilsa snorted. “Didn’t you hear what I said? Most people learn 6 or less… in a year. You’ll probably be finished with the academy by the time you’ve learned everything inside that book. Assuming you want to, of course – I’m not making you do anything.”\r\n\r\n“6 in a year, huh?” asked Zorian carefully, an idea forming in his mind.\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” Ilsa confirmed.\r\n\r\n“So what if I could master all 15 before this month is done?” asked Zorian.\r\n\r\nIlsa stared at him for a second before bursting into laughter. It took her a few seconds to calm down.\r\n\r\n“My, aren’t you the confident one?” Ilsa said, chuckling softly. “If you were really that good, I’d fill out the transfer forms right now, regulations be damned, and take you as my apprentice. I’d never pass up an opportunity to teach such a legend in the making. Not that I think you could do it, mind you.”\r\n\r\nZorian just gave her a wicked smile.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nOf course, there was absolutely no chance for Zorian to master all 15 exercises in this particular restart, but that was beside the point. Thanks to the wonder of the time loop, he had far more than a few measly weeks to learn the contents of the book. It was even available in the academy library, so he didn’t have to go to Ilsa in the next restart to acquire it. And who knew, maybe if he learned those he could get Xvim to cut him some slack too. A man could dream.\r\n\r\nBesides, the book was actually fairly interesting. Not only did it explain how to perform each variation in great detail, it also explained the reasons for including each particular exercise, as well as providing a background for understanding why the basic three were being taught to students in the first place. Zorian briefly familiarized himself with each of the variations before starting to read earnestly from the start.\r\n\r\nMaking an object glow, levitating it, or setting it aflame… these were very simple effects, requiring only rudimentary shaping skills. The levitation exercise, for instance, was just repelling force emanating from the mage’s palm. It doesn’t get much simpler than that. There were actually a lot of these simple effects, certainly more than the three they were taught, but these three were deemed a priority. Production of light, heat, or kinetic force were common components of many spells, giving the basic three the sort of general usefulness that most other simple exercises lacked.\r\n\r\nThe variations listed in the book were not in the same category as these simple, or starter exercises. Although Xvim, Ilsa, and the book itself referred to them as ‘variations’, Zorian realized they were more like ‘upgrades’, or perhaps ‘advanced versions’. He hadn’t realized it at the time, but the pen spinning exercise – which was the very first variation outlined in the book, albeit under a fancier name – was a whole other category of difficulty from simply levitating the pen above his palm. Not only did he have to maintain the levitation effect on the pen, he also had to shape an additional effect to make the pen spin. The variation was supposed to teach mages how to multitask, by making them maintain two effects at once.\r\n\r\nThough Xvim would have disagreed, Zorian considered his pen spinning exercise mastered, and the guidelines in the book seemed to agree with him. As such, he started poring over the other 4 variations of the levitation exercise, trying to figure out which one was the easiest. He quickly realized they were not only arranged in an ascending order of difficulty, but that mastering the later variations probably requires mastering the preceding ones first.\r\n\r\nVertical levitation required him to make an object stick to his palm with attractive force, position his palm vertically and then make the object separate from his palm without falling down. The sticking part was easy, and something Zorian could already do, but making the object float off the palm without falling required that he balances the attractive force binding the object to his palm and the repelling force that made it separate from it. Without the ability to multitask he acquired from the pen spinning exercise, it probably would have taken forever to master this one.\r\n\r\nNext was fixed position levitation, which required an ability to maintain the levitated object’s position in space despite disruptions and changes in initial conditions. In other words, he had to be able to move his hand up and down, left and right, while keeping the levitated object static in space. It required the ability to balance attractive and repelling force he presumably acquired from the vertical levitation exercise, but this time he had to continually adjust the balance in response to changes.\r\n\r\nAnd so on. Seeing how there was only one correct order in which these exercises could be learned, Zorian started practicing vertical levitation. Unfortunately, he wouldn’t accomplish much in this particular restart.\r\n\r\nThe summer festival was approaching.'),
('Prologue-Smelting 1', 'Forge of Destiny', 1, '\r\n\r\nThe carriage was impossibly fast, Ling Qi thought, as she stared out the tiny window at a landscape that was little more than a green and brown blur. She knew she should be excited, maybe awed; she was witnessing the power of Immortals after all. It wasn’t something a girl like her could have ever expected to see.\r\n\r\nInstead, she simply felt numb. Absently, she brushed a strand of unruly black hair out of her eyes. She had let it get too long again, hanging down below her ears as it was. She was being taken to the Wall, the impassable mountains that formed the southern border of the Emerald Seas province. The carriage was bound for the Argent Sect that resided there, and it was all because a terrifying man in a porcelain mask had said that she had the talent to become an Immortal.\r\n\r\nIt was why she sometimes heard voices no one else could hear, why she could feel strange presences when she ventured out to the outskirts of the city where the wards against the spirit beasts were porous and weak. She had always assumed she had been born a bit crazy.\r\n\r\nBoyish, inelegant, crazy Ling Qi, who ran away rather than play doll for her mother.\r\n\r\nIt had grated when she was younger, listening to her mother’s complaints about her appearance and demeanor, hearing the frustration in the woman’s voice when she talked about her. Ling Qi was too tall, too thick of limb, her skin too dark, and her features too long and lacking refinement.\r\n\r\nShe couldn’t say she regretted leaving. It wasn’t as if Mother had tried very hard to find her in the four years since she had run off. Ling Qi blew the stubborn strand of hair out of her eyes again and turned her thoughts away from the past. It was pointless now; she would never grow up to be like her Mother, and so, she had left. She was free, even if it meant facing hunger and cold. Even if it meant she had often been hurt or frightened. She might be ugly, be poor, but she was herself, did as she wanted, which to her was all that mattered. It had to be.\r\n\r\nWhich was why this grated on her.\r\n\r\nShe should have been ecstatic, the only commoner from her city that had the talent... Would any other denizen of Tonghou be able to raise their heads in front of her by the time she was done training? Would even Mother be able to criticize her? No, of course not.\r\n\r\nShe still wasn’t happy though, because once again she found herself without a choice. She had no money, no resources. Even if she had gone back to Mother, the woman wouldn’t have been able to pay the fees described by the recruiter, and if she had refused to go along to the sect, her talent would be removed. She hated the idea of something that was hers being taken away even more.\r\n\r\nSo once she was done training, she would owe the Empire eight years of military service instead. Not very long at all in an Immortal’s lifespan, she had been assured. Really she couldn’t say that the idea of facing off against the wind riding mountain barbarians like a figure out of a story didn’t excite her.\r\n\r\nShe just hated not having a choice.\r\n\r\nLing Qi shook her head and turned away from the blurring landscape outside the carriage window. The carriage was eerily quiet. More magic, she supposed, and despite her misgivings, she couldn’t help the spark of excitement she felt at the thought.\r\n\r\nStill, it had been hours since they left, and she was bored. Even at this speed, it would still be some time until she arrived. So rather than continuing to mope about the past, she decided to turn her attention to the leather satchel sitting on the bench across from her. It contained her meager possessions: a few coins, some clothing, and an old wooden flute that she had liked to play on occasion. Mother’s music lessons had been one of her happier memories.\r\n\r\nIt also contained what she had been provided by the recruiter. Reaching over, Ling Qi picked up the bag and flipped it open. Peering inside, she ran her fingers over the bundle of grey cloth that sat on top. She once again marveled at the smooth softness of the material. Her disciple’s uniform, the man had said. Something provided to less well off disciples, since normal clothing would have difficulty holding up to the rigors of training.\r\n\r\nThere were a few other things too: a hand mirror, a comb, and a sewing kit, among a few other miscellaneous items. She supposed the implication was that she should make herself presentable before she arrived. She glanced down at her rather ragged brown shirt, pants, and muddy sandals. Not exactly the most impressive outfit.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time in a long time that it might matter though. She hadn’t had much time before she had been shuffled into the carriage. If she was going to make an effort, she should do it now. Ling Qi glanced toward the locked door on the other side of the carriage, then back toward the window. There was enough space at least; it really seemed like the carriage was meant for several people. After another moment contemplating the contents of the satchel, she drew the shutter down over the window and got to work changing.\r\n\r\nSome time later, Ling Qi sat back down with a frown on her face, idly smoothing the wrinkles out of the amazingly soft gray fabric of the outfit she now wore. It was… nice, but she hadn’t worn a dress in years. At least it didn’t pinch and cling like the ones Mother used to try and make her wear.\r\n\r\nIt was layered and cut on the bottom half to allow for easy movement, but annoyingly loose around her hips. She had had to bunch up the sash and tie it twice. At least the wide, billowy sleeves would be good for concealing her hands. She could also hide things inside them pretty easily with a bit of work. The embroidery of clouds and stylized wind currents were kind of nice too.\r\n\r\nShe still felt uncomfortable though. It felt strange to wear something that probably cost more than a month of a laborer’s wages. Well, maybe whatever this was made of was the Immortal equivalent of sack cloth? She glanced down at the mirror in her hands. There weren’t any cosmetics provided thankfully, so apparently they didn’t expect her to dress up that much.\r\n\r\nThere had been a few hairpins though, made of some kind of painted bone. She thought they went well with her bright blue eyes. That was her best feature in her own opinion. No one else in her hometown had eyes that shade. Not that her effort at pinning up her hair in some resemblance of order had prevented the strands from falling back into her eyes. Maybe she could learn some kind of magic to manage that, she thought idly.\r\n\r\nAs she put the mirror away and reached for the clean sandals that had been under the uniform, the carriage suddenly jerked, almost sending her tumbling headfirst into her bag. Snapping a hand up to grab the frame of the window, she managed to steady herself.\r\n\r\n“Be ready. We’re nearly at the entrance plaza,” sounded the voice of the man who was driving the carriage. He had seemed… less formal than she would imagine an Immortal to be, greeting her kindly as she had passed the two adults to enter the carriage.\r\n\r\nCuriously, she lifted the shutter that she had pulled down over the window. They were now moving along at a much more normal pace while traveling up a meandering mountain path. Somehow, the inside of the carriage remained level despite the slope.\r\n\r\n“I will be ready shortly,” Ling Qi called back after a moment’s hesitation. Whatever had been blocking the sounds from outside was gone, she noticed with a start. She could hear birdsong and the sound of the horse’s hooves again as well.\r\n\r\n“H-how long do I have?” she asked tentatively a moment later, frowning at the hesitant stutter that had come out despite her best efforts. She was nervous, but she couldn’t let them see that. One thing she had learned quite well by now was that the appearance of confidence was important.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’ve got a few more minutes more,” the man called back in a lackadaisical tone. “The Sect doesn’t like us speeding on the mountain, at least for those of us stuck on the ground anyway.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi blinked. Was he implying that some would be arriving by flight? She had heard stories… but had thought that mostly the domain of the mountain barbarians.\r\n\r\n“Thank you. I’ll just be a moment.” It felt strange to revert to the speech Mother had taught rather than the more relaxed kind she had gotten used to in the last few years, but it felt like a good idea. If there was one thing Mother had been right about, it was that first impressions mattered.\r\n\r\nShaking off such thoughts for the moment, she reached down for the sandals, a determined expression on her face. She would need to be ready.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage finally came to a stop, Ling Qi felt she was as prepared as she could be, given that she didn’t precisely know what was coming next. The driver hadn’t said anything else, and neither had she, preoccupied as she had been with trying to focus and keeping the nervous thoughts that kept flitting through her head from showing.\r\n\r\nThere was a thud from outside and the sound of footsteps walking around the carriage as she stood, self-consciously smoothing the wrinkles in her new uniform. Shortly thereafter, there was another click and the door opened, revealing the driver.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to read his face, or anything really, given how well covered he was. He wore a strange, wide brimmed hat from which hung paper slips covered in odd symbols. It left his eyes barely visible in the gaps between the slips. The high collar of his deep blue robe rose to meet the hangings, concealing the rest of his face. Somehow, he managed to give the impression that he was smiling.\r\n\r\n“Need a hand getting down?” he asked pleasantly offering a gloved hand to her.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be fine, thank you,” Ling Qi responded with confidence she didn’t quite feel, hesitating only a moment before picking up the now lightened satchel and stepping down slowly to avoid tripping on the hem of her dress.\r\n\r\nAs she reached the bottom of the steps, she finally got a look at her surroundings. The two of them stood on a wide stone plaza built upon a plateau carved into the mountainside. She could see the steep road they had traveled to get here wind past the ornate gate that broke the stone fence encircling the plaza and vanishing into the mist below.\r\n\r\nThere was only a single building here, a large two story structure with a high peaked roof that reminded her both of a temple and the scholars’ testing hall in Tonghou City. The plaza was dotted with small, tastefully arranged gardens centered around tall peach trees. There was still a trickle of people going into the building dressed in similar uniforms, as well as several other similar carriages, each with their own eclectically dressed driver.\r\n\r\n“Hey, might not want to stand around staring too long.” She startled as the driver’s amused voice jolted her from her thoughts. Ling Qi glanced over at him and then back to the central building. He was facing away from her, working to free the odd, blue furred horses from their harness.\r\n\r\n“You’re in the last group of arrivals so one of the elders will be down soon to lay out the rules. You’re assigned to hall one by the way.” He patted one of the horses on the neck, drawing a snort from the beast, as he turned back to face her.\r\n\r\nLing Qi still hadn’t gotten a proper look at his face, but somehow, the tilt of his head gave the impression that he was examining her, making her straighten her posture unconsciously.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she responded after a moment. “And… where is hall one? And is there anything else I should know?”\r\n\r\n“In the front door. Just follow the signs,” he responded dismissively, crossing his arms. The act tugged the long sleeves of his robe up, showing that his gloves extended to at least his elbows. He paused, once again giving her the feeling of being appraised.\r\n\r\n“The Elders will lay out the rules. Just be respectful,” he added in a lazy tone. “But… find some friends and be quick about it. Loners tend to have trouble. You can’t watch your back all the time, you know?” His monstrosity of a hat tilted to the side, and she got the impression that he was smiling again. “Call it advice from a senior who was in a similar spot.”\r\n\r\nShe… had never been particularly good at making friends, much less keeping them, but she could take friendly advice with good grace.\r\n\r\n“Thank you again. I should be on my way though.” Her voice was more hesitant than she would have liked. She turned to head toward the building then stopped.\r\n\r\n“Might I know your name?” she asked. It seemed silly to not at least introduce herself to someone who seemed helpful.\r\n\r\n“Dong Fu,” he responded easily. “You’re right. Get going. You don’t want to be late, and I already know your name.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi dipped her head in his direction and set off, hurrying along as fast as she could manage in her new clothes.\r\n\r\nThe Sect’s central building loomed ahead. Somehow, she knew, things would never be quite the same again once she crossed that threshold.\r\n\r\n');

('Quissing the Dungeon', 'There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.', 9, '\r\n\r\nWell… it wasn’t a War Chief.\r\n\r\nQuiss eyed the hole set into the side of a large clearing. The sign tacked to the top of the entrance was clear in its intent. Quiss rolled his tongue around, digging out egg from between two teeth.\r\n\r\nNormally, a Dungeon usually did it’s best to lure people in byways of warmth, alluring entrances, women’s laughter, a flash of gold.\r\n\r\nThings that might have the average man enticed.\r\n\r\nQuiss had never quite heard of a Dungeon telling people to piss off; then again that would be clever. Nothing made a man, a little drunk after a long day, angry like an inanimate object telling him to keep out.\r\n\r\nSeldom did men like being told what to do by innocent objects. In Quiss’ questionable education, he found that a Dungeon was usually one thing.\r\n\r\nTrouble.\r\n\r\nWell, he was being unfair. The richness of the hill grass around him, the blooming flowers hiding just out of sight in the underbrush, the screeching noises of animals trying to bed one another, usually in dangerous fashion, and even the clear babbling noises of nearby rivers sounded out.\r\n\r\nDungeons were good for the land. It was akin to a blackout that sucked up crappy mana and objects and leaked much better mana over time. Like a strict husband or wife that took in a lout of a man out of the gutter, bedded him, wed him, then cleaned up his act.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that was Quiss’ own personal perfect logical thoughts on marriage shining through again, but he dismissed that thought before he shot the happy singing bird not far off.\r\n\r\nDungeons also had a high mortality rate. Quiss didn’t even find it funny anymore. Idiots waited in lines for months for a turn in some slimy dungeon and instead of training, they would sleep or gamble away their grandfather’s rusty set of Mythril armour that definitely would have saved their lives.\r\n\r\nQuiss honestly found the Dungeon culture to be a bit of a mess. Verluan had a handful of the things. A great city had been built around one once and then it promptly collapsed as they failed to take into account such things as trade routes, seasonal changes, general meaning of what it would take to keep a city running off random-chance loot drops and chests that may or may not kill you.\r\n\r\nLast he heard, the city had decided to downgrade to a heroic villa for adventurers to spend the day in a spa before heading off to strike mediocre riches or die from a slime that looked like a mundane slime but was actually a royal jelly.\r\n\r\nCommon mistake, not one people often made twice. His research into the deepest dark tomes and scrolls had revealed the way to discern the way to tell the difference. The royal jelly had a tiny crown and oozed with elegance.\r\n\r\nQuiss turned and, without much hurry, walked back to the village. He needed to call a town meeting and that meant waking up Haldi.\r\n\r\nQuiss’ features soured to the point he felt ill. Why did he have to wake Haldi? He sighed and patted his navy jacket. PeaceKeeper duties at their finest. He briefly entertained the idea of letting the dungeon be and ignore it until problems cropped up.\r\n\r\nBut… it sounded like it had already eaten one hunting party and a farmer… and maybe a pig.\r\n\r\nThose were problems. Quiss rolled his tongue again and eyed the forest to the far side. The thought came into his head despite his protests.\r\n\r\nThe monsters of the forest would be drawn to this area. Goblins, Unreasonably Large Spiders, lizard people who decided to kill other people and angry bushes.\r\n\r\nQuiss hoped the bushes stayed in the forest. He’d rather not fight them again. His allergies acted up at the worst times when he was casting a spell. A fireball was not meant to defy natural order like it did the last time he sneezed mid-cast and burned a goblin into a duck.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe room of webs was coming along nicely. Delta zipped in and zipped back out, doing the dance when she thought some web had pierced reality and touched her ghostly self.\r\n\r\nShe rubbed her face, the area feeling itchy. There was an oddly wavy line that one could traverse without getting the thick webs in their face but even to her eyes, it took an aerial view to see it clearly.\r\n\r\nSure… the adventures could just burn it all but Delta had planned for that! In the middle of the room was something she hoped would… stall the idea of fire.\r\n\r\nDelta cackled as she suggested the idea to her powers and it came back positive. A berry could indeed germinate into a berry bush. It seemed with some additional mana cost, she could just up and skip the growth stage. The only off thing is that bush came without berries.\r\n\r\n    Healthy Berry Bush: A bush that can grow Healthy Berries over time. Cost 10 Mana\r\n\r\nSure, it was costly but in the midst of all the white web, a shimmering shape of green with royal red berries would entice the adventures. Delta definitely was proud of her little challenge room., her face wide with a pleased look.\r\n\r\nEspecially, since she wanted to make the spider room unavoidable as she messed the dungeon up.\r\n\r\nHob and Gob went back out with the bucket. Delta asked them to go back to the river and find her some fish. She would have made them some bags or a fishing pole, but she lacked some materials. Despite the fact her spiders could make the web, her dungeon didn’t register her to have the ability to make a fishing rod.\r\n\r\nOr did video games lie to her? Delta perished the thought and hummed cheerfully down the tunnel as she waited for delicious mana to return. Still,… with nothing to do, she peeked into the grove and got another development going.\r\n\r\nShe randomly picked the glow in the dark ones and moved on.\r\n\r\nWow… she still had 78 Dp to spend… how fast was she supposed to be growing?\r\n\r\nShrugging, Delta read through the menu, looking for something to catch her eye.\r\n\r\n    Upgrade dungeon dirt walls into wood reinforced dirt walls: 10 DP\r\n\r\nDelta… looked around and then purchased it with a small thrill running through her body.\r\n\r\nThen the dungeon shook.\r\n\r\n“Uh… no, stop making that noise!” she begged as the entire floor shook harder. The walls began to glow softly and then like a firework, flashed brightly making Delta’s non-physical eyes go blind.\r\n\r\n“Flipping flops!” she cursed and rubbed at them.\r\n\r\nThe shaking stopped and Delta blinked blearily at the almost solid looking dirt that her tunnels now had. Were that planks of wood across some patches?\r\n\r\nEvery so often, the dirt had oddly angled pieces of lumber nailed to support beams. Never straight and never fully hiding the dirt behind it.\r\n\r\nThe tunnels were also… a little roomier. Delta felt off like someone had added an extra ear to one side of her head. She tried to pace and the spacing made her confused. This was a little annoying. Her depth and spatial awareness were now shot to fudge. She paced and tried to ignore the extra foot and half of with the tunnels now had.\r\n\r\nDelta paced, trying to find her stride, forgetting to purchase anything else for a while.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n“Haldi?” Quiss called into the deep darkness.\r\n\r\nThe yawning abyss of the doorway before Quiss beckoned him closer like a snake with a hypnotic rattler. Quiss refused to parley with the darkness, ignoring it like the ex-lover that had spilt wine on his favourite ‘Mad Magicians Monthly’ and expected him to hurry up and get over it.\r\n\r\nWell, sadly for the darkness, Quiss Firesmasher held grudges like a pro-mage. Often with no reason and often lasting until the grave took him and even then he would come back as a ghost just to spite them, it was just small things.\r\n\r\n“Haldi!” he yelled and the air trembled as the being inside shifted. People on the street behind him grabbed their young or old and hurried away.\r\n\r\nQuiss yearned for one of them to take his hand and hurry away with him. No one did and Quiss chalked that up as another reason to dislike people.\r\n\r\nThe master of this terrible place approached the sunlight and it seemed to move equally away from him.\r\n\r\n“Haldi?” Quiss repeated and the figure moved closer.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Quiss, come for another sample?” the old man offered with a smile. Quiss ignored the silver dish of various cheese with cocktail sticks holding them together. The man was a little over eternity, his features ranged from ghastly to nightmarish, his average speed per word was between glacier and time-stopping.\r\n\r\n“Haldi, I need to use the bell,” Quiss said calmly, ignoring how one of the cheese samples was bubbling. Haldi nodded twice.\r\n\r\nQuiss was sure seasons passed by the time it took Haldi to finish the second nod. The smell of the building wafted out, it wasn’t cheese. No, that would be normal for Haldi the cheesemaker. No, the smell that leaked from Haldi’s shop seemed like the forgotten space between the second and third layer of the abyss. Out of the 142 layers, the first 20 weren’t so bad in terms of dying.\r\n\r\nSo people just felt mild discomfort when shopping for cheese in this town. No one talked about it and its implications. No one really cared enough or had enough willpower to face Haldi in a conversation longer than 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe one conversation that did last that long had been legendary and the archmage had died on the spot, his ghost fleeing for hills.\r\n\r\nHaldi had been ruling with a cheesy fist from the darkness… by accident.\r\n\r\nHe was actually a very nice man but Quiss wanted to cry. He was so boring. However, when most men were still presumably in the evolutionary stage of bacteria; Haldi had purchased the oldest church in town. It was the only church in town with a bell.\r\n\r\nAnd by Durence law of the covenant of the pact overruled by the agreement between three wizards that was overturned by the Barbershop Quartet of the dark ages…. Town meetings could only be forced by the ringing of the church bell by standard practice still held today.\r\n\r\nSo, Haldi nodded and then opened his mouth.\r\n\r\n“I learned the most interesting thing about cheese last month! Did you know…” Haldi began and the stairs at the far end looked blocked off by cheese crates. They would need to be moved but something had leaked over them, making them sticky to the touch.\r\n\r\n“-warmed by a basilisk, then a fondue can actually not leak off the sweet stick!” Haldi went on and Quiss grew weak. He must hurry before the cheesy abyss took him!\r\n'),
('Rebirth', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 1, '\r\n\r\nA raw, primal scream was being wrenched from my throat, my mind and body wracked by pain. The pain of loss, the pain of death, the pain of ending.\r\n\r\nA crisp snap broke through my screaming, the pair of fingers that did the deed appearing in my vision. An old pair of fingers started the snap; a young pair of fingers ended the snap. I felt a strange force invade my mind, grab something, twist, and rip. I cried out in pain, a sense of loss washing over me. My mouth closed, every breath sending fresh flames of torment radiating from my lungs.\r\n\r\nA tall, thin man was in front of me, speaking. “I do really hate the screaming, but I suppose that’s what happens when you mortals die.”\r\n\r\nWait what!? Die!? I was in class just a second ago! What did he mean die!? I was too young to die! I could feel the panic quickly mounting again, my breath becoming shorter and faster as I started to hyperventilate.\r\n\r\n“Who are you? Where is this? What do you mean die!?”\r\n\r\nAs I shot my questions off rapid-fire, I looked around.\r\n\r\nI was disoriented. Dazed. Pain and anguish were clawing at my heart, my mind, my very soul, but slowly, oh so slowly, it was starting to fade.\r\n\r\nUntil I noticed where I was. And where I wasn’t.\r\n\r\nThen it all came rushing back, and while I’d been silenced nothing stopped me from hyperventilating there’snoairhereohmygod!\r\n\r\nA pair of fingers snapped again, and the man spoke once more, derision dripping from the single word he uttered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Honestly.”\r\n\r\nMy mind cleared.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI wasn’t sure where I was anymore – I seemed to be floating in space, surrounded by twinkling stars and galaxies, comets and planets. It wasn’t home, it wasn’t school, it wasn’t even earth. There was nobody present except the tall thin man, floating impossibly in front of me, looking both ancient and young, happy and sad, male and female, tall and short, fat and skinny, red and blue – wait what?\r\n\r\nI pinched myself, putting all my might into it. Only thing to do really. This dream was way too trippy for me.\r\n\r\nI jumped as an electric shock went through me. I was still here, wherever here was. That didn’t bode well.\r\n\r\nI might be in a minor spot of serious trouble.\r\n\r\nA deep, long-suffering sigh escaped him? Her?\r\n\r\n“You died. I took the memory of you dying to calm you down. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to have worked nearly as well as it should’ve.”, and I heard, barely under her breath “Mortals.”\r\n\r\nI felt an enforced calmness come over me, my panic not going away, just… not mattering anymore. Given where I was, strange floating among the stars with what can only be described as a super powerful shape-shifter, I could believe I had died. This wasn’t Kansas anymore.\r\n\r\n“Now then, we can have a discussion. You have died. Your soul has failed to properly re-enter the cycle of reincarnation, and I found you just floating in the void.”\r\n\r\nTheir face twisted in an unhappy grimace, and I felt an instinctive fear run through my…\r\n\r\nDid I even have a body anymore? Was I just a soul now?\r\n\r\nI didn\'t know what to make of being told I’d died, that my life was over. I did know that I hadn’t been old, or even middle-aged when I died. Had I even made it to adulthood!? I tried to make a disgruntled noise – the enforced calm was preventing any sort of outrage, only to discover that I couldn’t make a sound.\r\n\r\nThat bastard.\r\n\r\nWe couldn’t have a ‘discussion’ if I couldn’t say a single word! I guess he just wanted to monologue, and my input could take a jolly hike.\r\n\r\n“I’m Papilion, the God of Change,” she grandly announced, to an audience of one – and that constant shifting of male to female, young to old, pleased to outraged made a bit more sense, although it was giving me a pounding headache to follow. “And you’re being reincarnated. Normally, as souls are reincarnated through the cycle of life and death, all of their memories are erased. They’re given a clean slate to start over. I don’t know what to make of you, a lone soul lost to Samsara, so you have the option of keeping some of your memories. Regrettably, a newborn’s mind is simply too small for all of the things you know, and you do know quite a few dangerous things. What is your choice? Would you like to start as a blank slate, a new life? Or keep some of your knowledge, some of who you are, knowing that you’ll never be able to go back, be forever incomplete, missing a part of yourself?”\r\n\r\nI wasn’t ready to make a decision of this scale. Hell, 10 minutes ago by my reckoning, I was debating what to eat for lunch, deciding if I wanted to buy that dress or not, and figuring out how to get all my homework done!\r\n\r\nPoof! Like a magician’s disappearing act, it was all gone! A mote of dust in the breeze, smoke wrapped in the wind, the last ember soaked in water.\r\n\r\nMy entire life was over. Everything I’d worked for and accomplished gone in a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nThe crushing weight of that threatened to overwhelm me, but then the absurdity hit.\r\n\r\nI was dead. It wasn’t like I could make any worse choices now, could I?\r\n\r\nWhat was the worst that could happen now?\r\n\r\nOn one hand, I could keep my memories. Sounded painful, more emotional than physical. I would lose everyone I had ever known – my parents, my best friend, my brother, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends – everyone. I would know it. I would be aware. It was like a plague went through and I had to attend a hundred funerals at once, but the only funeral anyone would be attending was mine. The option to just… forget… was tempting, especially if it was as thorough as removing the memory of me dying was.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it sounded like this was a rare chance. Not everyone got to keep their memories – even if it was only a fraction of them – and start over again, tabula rasa. It was tempting, just for the aspect of doing something nobody – wait, maybe this had happened before – had done.\r\n\r\n“Can… can I ask some questions….?” I asked, getting a single arched eyebrow back as a response. That might be a “go ahead”, but it might also be a “you dare question me mortal”, and I wasn’t going to play games with my life. Err… afterlife? Soul? Reincarnation?\r\n\r\nI decided not to ask any questions, and mull it over myself. There wasn’t much more to add.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I felt that the choice was forced. As some famous philosopher said “You die twice. Once when you die, and once when someone speaks your name for the last time.” I might have died and lost my first body, but my soul and memories were intact. That was alive enough for me, and I fully intended to keep it that way. I was too young to die.\r\n\r\n“I would like to keep my memories.” I said with far more confidence than I felt. The god in front of me smiled as he started to morph into a strange bird – it looked like a crow, but it had too many feet. Somehow, his voice was all the same coming out of a beak.\r\n\r\n“Right then. Chemistry, gone. Physics, gone. Far too dangerous to know that where you’re going. Scientific method – you can do too much damage with that. Broad strokes of history – fine, but the details are completely superfluous, and we need to make room. Mathematics – keep the basics, but calculus will do nothing for you where you’re headed. Arts, literature – useless, but removing it will change you too much. There’s not much point in letting you keep your memories if you’re a completely different person. Interpersonal relationships – they can stay, same reason. English – I suppose you need a starting baseline. French? Spanish? Entirely useless. Gone. Hmm… a few more things to clean up… and we’re done! Prepare to be reincarnated as a Golden Crow.”\r\n\r\nI felt the strange force from before entering my mind, magnitudes more powerful and painful than before, rooting around in my head. Each time the crow squawked, I felt something rip out from my mind, and I tried to hold back tears of pain. By the time math was gone – I never liked it, but was indescribably sad at it leaving – I was curled up on the floor weeping silently. Not that there was a floor, just more floating in space. But when he said ‘Prepare to be reincarnated as a Golden Crow” I shot up, panic racing through me, somehow about to speak again.\r\n\r\n“NO! I WANT TO BE HUMAN! MAKE ME HUMAN! HUMA-“\r\n\r\nA pair of fingers snapped.\r\n\r\nI was floating in warm, wet darkness. I had been floating here for quite some time, and I was doing lots of thinking. My first instinct was that it was all a bad dream, but I had fallen asleep and woken up too often for that to be the case. So, it seemed like I had truly died, and was being reincarnated.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I was unsure about was if I was going to be human, a ‘Golden Crow’, whatever that was, or something else entirely. This whole reincarnation thing really needed a user manual or something. I didn’t seem to have a shell, but there was no telling really.\r\n\r\nAt least, I was pretty sure something called a crow would be hatched from an egg. Who knew what I actually knew and what got ripped out by that cruel, capricious god. Who knew what was real, and what I just made up on my own as I floated here in the dark, trying desperately to plug the holes in my memories, holes where I knew things should be but were not.\r\n\r\nI wanted to go home. I wanted to see mom again. I wanted dad to hug me, to tell me everything was going to be ok. Maybe I could look them up on the internet when I was old enough, tell them that I was ok. Would they even believe me? Would they think it’s just some cruel hoax?\r\n\r\nI could probably tell them enough about me, enough about them, growing up. How the sun hit the windows, how it would go through the crude ‘stained glass’ plastic I made in 4th grade. That Becky was my best friend until 2nd grade, when she moved. How our dog Aoife used to eat anything and everything – proven by the Great Banana Peel Experiment – and was taken too soon. What was an ‘experiment’ anyways?\r\n\r\nThe fact that some knowledge was considered “too dangerous” for where I was going implied that I wasn’t heading back to the time I came from. I thinly tried to hold on hope that Papilion had meant “too dangerous to be born knowing so much”, but I knew I was just deluding myself. I grieved. I lamented. I cursed fate, cursed the gods. It changed nothing. They were most likely all lost to me.\r\n\r\nWaking period by waking period, the details of my past life got dulled, along with the pain of losing everyone I knew. Random things stayed – like why did I still know my bus schedule? How did that stay, why didn’t it get stripped out? Others faded. I could only name half of the people in my biology class, I had no idea who my teachers were last year, and the details of the latest book I had been reading were gone.\r\n\r\nGod, I wanted to read again. To pick up a book, sit in a cozy chair by the fire, and just lose myself in the pages. Rarely was I so happy as when I was reading. Although, “God” might be a bit of a strange epithet, after now knowing there were gods, and it didn’t seem like there was just one. Otherwise he (she? Them? What pronoun did a shape-shifting god (goddess??) use anyways? – I decided to use he, since that was the first and the last form shown to save my sanity until said god of change told me otherwise.) probably wouldn’t have referred to himself as “the god of change”, and probably just “god”. God. This was tricky.\r\n\r\nI had entirely too much time to think, and nothing else to do. I tried flailing about now and then, just for a change of pace, but I rapidly hit soft walls all around me that absorbed what I did and gave. I tried to brace myself and push out, but had no luck. I would rapidly tire out and fall asleep after each attempt.\r\n\r\nI kept at it though, because there was nothing else to do. Except think. And there was nobody to bounce my thoughts off of, nobody to interact with, and just far too much time on my hands (claws? Please not claws.) God. Gods.\r\n\r\nI occasionally heard noises, as if coming off from a great distance underwater, but couldn’t make anything out. I would redouble my escape efforts whenever I heard that – maybe someone could let me out? But it never made a difference. The noises were usually soothing, which was nice, but being unable to really make anything out, it wasn’t that much of a change. At least it broke up the monotony. Inevitably after each attempt, I would get exhausted and fall asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen would this end?\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs couldn’t last, and one day I felt the fleshy walls of my prison contract around me, squeezing me. I felt a sharp spike of fear go through me, and I flailed more in panic. There wasn’t anything else I could do. This did seem to strongly imply that I didn’t need to escape with a beak, which gave me a brief sense of relief – only for panic to set in once again as the walls contracted around me, squeezing all over. Again, and again, pain and pause, the relief between each movement constantly shortened. I was battered, I felt bruised all over, but finally, with one last massive squeeze, I emerged into the world, and a massive deluge of information.\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Welcome to Pallos!]\r\n\r\n[Name: Elaine]\r\n\r\n[Race: Human]\r\n\r\n[Age: 0]\r\n\r\n[Time remaining on System locks: 68,820:43:16]\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Due to the great efforts of [Hero] Herculix, you get a +1 bonus to all stats!

But more than that –\r\n\r\nGiants. Giants all around me. Some yelling, some screaming, two covered in blood. The noise grated, and went right between my ears, nails on chalkboard. I was picked up, incomprehensible language babbled all around me, and looking down, I saw a female giant bleeding profusely. Another giantess elbowed her way in, put her hand on the first giant, yelled something, and I watched the flesh of the first giant knit itself back together!\r\n\r\nHoly shitballs there was magic here!\r\n\r\nI looked up for the first time, and realized that we were in a field under the open sky. I was passed down to the giantess who was healed, my head being moved around as I saw more of the night sky, and I saw them.\r\n\r\nTwo crimson cat’s eyes with slitted pupils glared down from the sky to me, watching me, seeing every movement I made. I could feel the weight of its ominous gaze pressing on me, suffocating. The strange floating words, being manhandled by giants, the screaming, getting battered and bruised, the blood, the magic - it was too much. I screamed and cried and flailed about, and didn’t stop until my voice gave out and I passed out from exhaustion.\r\n\r\n'),
('Rice Farming 101', 'Beware of Chicken', 2, 'I jolted awake to Big D’s furious battle cry, and the angry sqwalling of a fox. I had a shovel in my hand and was out the door as fast as I could into the extremely pleasant night.\r\n\r\nBig D was flapping around the fox’s head, kicking at it furiously. He was too young for his spurs to deal any damage, but he was trying his little heart out.\r\n\r\nI was transfixed for a moment, as David challenged Goliath.\r\n\r\nUntil the fox managed to hit him with it’s paw, and knocked him down and away. His footing was fouled. His fate was sealed. The Fox pounced, It’s razor sharp teeth going for the kill, to end my little warrior.\r\n\r\nOh? You dare trespass into this Daddy’s domain?!\r\n\r\n….I can’t believe I just thought that. I snort to myself.\r\n\r\nThe fox’s teeth clamped down on iron instead of flesh, and it looked up, shocked at the intervention.\r\n\r\nIt was then the fox realised it fucked up.\r\n\r\nMy shovel whirled, and with a klang! The fox died.\r\n\r\nI looked to my little warrior. He had managed to get to his feet, and was glaring as hatefully as he could at the fox’s corpse. I gave him a once over, and he was fine, as were my girls. Just a fright.\r\n\r\nI didn’t blame the fox, it was his nature. I hoped he didn’t blame me for braining him with a shovel in retaliation.\r\n\r\nAnd then selling his fur, because I’m totally going to do that. And I think you can eat fox.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nYou can, in fact eat fox. wouldn’t recommend it. Tastes like ass.\r\n\r\n//////////\r\n\r\nGrowing rice properly involves a bit more than just chucking your seed into the ground and hoping for the best. I had witnessed the cultivation method of the farmers from the village, and they were a bit… lacking.\r\n\r\nFor example, the first thing you do is soak it in a 1/16 ratio of salted water. The rice seed with the greatest amount of endosperm, and therefore the best chance of a yield will sink to the bottom of your barrel, while the rest will float to the top.\r\n\r\nThen, after soaking, you plant the desirable seeds in wide buckets for the first part of their life as they sprout.\r\n\r\nThen, finally, you transplant them to your paddies. I always found it rather strange that rice does better when you rip it out of the soil and stuff it somewhere else than leaving it be.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that I learned most of this from reading a manga. Thanks, Shizuko. Cheating using techniques from the 1860s when I was in a mid-to pre-thousands world, like all true Isekai heroes!\r\n\r\nExcept guns would be pretty much useless, and I had no desire to conquer the world. Eh, rice is more important than that stuff anyways.\r\n\r\nBut enough about that. I was currently on the “sprouting” stage. The paddies themselves were under way, carved into the side of one of the hills in the terraced style, and fed by one of the small rivers, for when it finally came time to flood them.\r\n\r\nCultivator strength and endurance always did turn tasks that should have taken months or years into matters of mere days.\r\n\r\nThough sometimes I had a sneaking suspicion that my “zen” modes lasted for longer than I thought they did. I was always super hungry when they stopped, and occasionally Big D was giving me the gimlet eye when I got back home.\r\n\r\nCultivation be whack, yo.\r\n\r\nI grunted, as I finished examining the terrace wall for any potential defects. It looked pretty good, but just in case, I pushed some more of my qi into it, lending my spirit to help reinforce the wall, and strengthen the grass’ roots to keep everything steady.\r\n\r\nThe masters at the sects would probably have an aneurysm about how much qi I was “wasting”, but I didn’t see it as a waste. It was a resource. If you got it, use it. Besides, it didn’t take that long for it to come back. At the start of the next day I was normally feeling fresh as a daisy. Maybe if I was a better cultivator, or had bigger reserves, it might take longer, but I didn’t know, and didn’t care.\r\n\r\nYawning, I wandered back to my little house, Big D greeting me with his signature screech.\r\n\r\n“You tell em, Big D.” I scratched his head affectionately. His defeat hadn’t made him nervous, so that was good. He was still a little ball of piss and vinegar.\r\n\r\nMy Lowly Spiritual Herbs were growing in their buckets beside my sprouting rice. The spirit herbs needed qi to grow properly, and I figured, why not just juice the rice too? Can’t be any harm.\r\n\r\nI had also repotted the strange root I had found. I couldn’t just run off to the archive, so this was the only way I had to store it, and It had some qi to it. So It got a dousing too.\r\n\r\nI carefully infused my spirit into the water, and then picked up my watering can and got to work, with Big D sitting on my shoulder, occasionally hopping off to snap up a bug that dared try to assault my little grow operation.\r\n\r\nGood Boy. More spirit greens for you after dinner.\r\n\r\n/////\r\n\r\nAnd so things went. I had to brain a few more foxes and a starving looking wolf, but otherwise, things were largely peaceful.\r\n\r\nChop wood.\r\n\r\nBreak rock.\r\n\r\nPlant crop.\r\n\r\nNurture with qi.\r\n\r\nEat food.\r\n\r\nSleep.\r\n\r\nMonths pass.\r\n\r\nI love it here.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nThe Great Master had given him the name Bi De. He knew not what it meant, but he knew the name was his. He knew it was powerful.\r\n\r\nBut he was not.\r\n\r\nAwareness was a fickle thing. It came and it went. But he knew during those times. He thought. And he was elevated above those who were beneath him. During the night, his senses were sharper, to better alert the Great Master to interlopers, those of red fur and sharp teeth.\r\n\r\nBut every time he failed in something he knew was his duty, to defend the females, he knew great shame. His Great Master nurtured him without reservation anyways, treating him like a favoured son, and not the shameful thing he was.\r\n\r\nHe was weak. He had to grow in strength, and fulfill his destiny!\r\n\r\nHe rode upon the Great Master’s shoulder while he infused their food with his very essence, and struck from above upon the base creatures that dared to sup off his powerful essence.\r\n\r\nHe stood the night watch while the Great Master slept. He guarded the home while the Great Master completed his great wonders, commanding the land and taming the forest.\r\n\r\nHe watched, as the Great Master moved in the morning, his body flowing with wondrous skill.\r\n\r\nAnd so he sought to improve himself. He ran through the Great Master’s Lands. He jumped over the hills, and onto the giant branches of trees. He shoved his body against the Great Pots of Growth, until he could finally move them.\r\n\r\nAnd now, he stood upon the Great Pillars of The Fa Ram (another name with a surely sublime meaning), and gave it his all to imitate the Great Master, to have some pale imitation of his sublime skill.\r\n\r\nHis body soared through the air. His legs lashed out with strength unknown to his lesser kin. He danced as the Great Master danced. He did breath, as the Great Master drew breath.\r\n\r\nSomething swirled around him.\r\n\r\nWithin him.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nI smiled at Big D as he hopped and kicked along my fence.\r\n\r\nCute little guy. \r\n'),
('Smashing Start', 'There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.', 1, '\r\n\r\nThere was a name.\r\n\r\nIt was hers but it had been traded away. A second chance she was promised by the small, pleased child. He wasn’t a child, just what some sanity-chipping being decided what a child should look like to converse with her.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it derived some perverse pleasure from her squirming consciousness.\r\n\r\n“A name for a chance? I’m being very fair,” he promised. She knew it was a trick.\r\n\r\n“Of course it is, that’s the ‘name’ of the game,” the child had laughed with delight. She had felt stars shiver at the noise.\r\n\r\n“Now… maybe we’ll talk again when you become interesting. Now, I have to go meet the others, maybe you’ll meet them one day?” the thing said casually.\r\n\r\nThen she twisted, breaking into a thousand shards that shattered into countless motes that sundered into the basic existence of the universe.\r\n\r\nThen she was slapped together with little care and left in the smallest...darkest….room.\r\n\r\nShe turned and stared up the single tunnel that was quickly digging itself until it stopped and sunlight pierced her.\r\n\r\nShe turned, trying to move, slightly moving forward with no real sensation.\r\n\r\nThen with a moment of shock, she looked down.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing there. Empty air where a body and legs should have been.\r\n\r\nShe turned.\r\n\r\nA pulsing orange orb about the size of an orange sat encrusted in a single stalagmite. The sunlight hitting the orb made the room glow with light.\r\n\r\nShe moved closer and peered into the orb.\r\n\r\nThe light showed a tiny shadow in the amber like glass.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfectly round object that pulsed with a tiny light. On that orb, the fainting symbol could be seen.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nShe shuddered.\r\n\r\nFour?\r\n\r\nThis thing was… her?\r\n\r\nShe was just a number to that thing. Not the first… definitely not the last.\r\n\r\nWell… at least she wasn’t a tree or a frog!\r\n\r\nHopeless optimism was better than screaming fear was what she told herself.\r\n\r\nThe house may be on fire but at least she was warm!\r\n\r\nUgh… she was going to die here as some orb thing.\r\n\r\nWithout a name? No, she needed a name, something to defined herself and used to hold herself together with.\r\n\r\nShe pulled something that seemed to float by as she just stared at the orb.\r\n\r\nDelta.\r\n\r\nIt was kinda four-ish. It was better than Orby or screaming-wailing-ghost-girl. Definitely better than just ‘victim number four’.\r\n\r\nSo she, Delta, go to work on the next problem she had to tackle.\r\n\r\nMostly, why did the creepy-demon-child thing think she was going to be interesting as… an orb?\r\n\r\nDelta looked about and saw the walls were hard packed dirt, loose stones and not a lot else.\r\n\r\nCharming, she was underground, a ghost, and bound to an orb. Delta tried to march right up the tunnel but with a small pause saw a completely white wall where the sun was a moment ago.\r\n\r\nShe took ten steps back and the vision of some dense grass hills appeared.\r\n\r\nDelta took a step forward, the outside world vanished.\r\n\r\nOne step back and it reappeared.\r\n\r\nDelta inhaled and then swallowed a slight scream as she promptly turned around and floated back to the orb.\r\n\r\nSo, she couldn’t even leave.\r\n\r\nShe had to stay underground, stuck in some void state to hang about with some ominous globe of eerily light.\r\n\r\nShe was either a vampire, ghost, or a goth in the making. Delta hoped for a goth, she could really use some anger right now to keep her from going insane.\r\n\r\n“Well… it’s just me… and me?” Delta asked aloud and the orb pulsed again but then went quiet.\r\n\r\n“Hm… I can’t leave, this is the only room and you’re centre figure. Logic dictates you’re the key to my problems, logic also dictates I should have legs but let’s ignore that little factoid,” Delta spoke to the orb with a serious tone to her words.\r\n\r\n“I can’t move you, I can’t bash my head on you, you’re not exactly stimulating this conversation. I must admit, I’m kinda lost on what the frick I’m supposed to do with you!” Delta yelled.\r\n\r\nThe Orb remained smug in its silence.\r\n\r\n“Fine, you know what, orb-me, you’re a jackass! A mongrel, a low-life, a charlatan! A hoax, a poser, a bad move knock-off prop!” Delta hissed.\r\n\r\nThe orb pulsed, maybe in anger but Delta pushed it, needing any form of contact.\r\n\r\n“You, good me, are the worst orb I have ever heard of,” Delta sniffed.\r\n\r\nThe Orb was glowing fully now.\r\n\r\n“Your father was a cow and your mother a goblin with warts and no tee-” Delta was cut off as the orb let loose one final pulse and as if sighing with relief, the glow fled the orb and swirled around the room.\r\n\r\nThe comet of orange dust and light encircled one corner and took shape with before Delta.\r\n\r\nIt was small, haunched, and green.\r\n\r\n“Oh...no,” Delta whispered as a goblin sniffed the air before spotting the Orb in its odd stone pedestal.\r\n\r\n“Job?” it grunted.\r\n\r\nDelta could only crawl away, not making any noise, mind reverting to some tiny mouse state.\r\n\r\nShe had nobody but that thought only added to her panic instead of easing it. What if she couldn’t feel anything anymore?!\r\n\r\nDelta heaved as the goblin blinked.\r\n\r\n“Rooms?” it offered. Delta just stared at where her hands should be.\r\n\r\nHow would she hold sandwiches? How would she type on the internet?\r\n\r\nWait… what if there was no internet?\r\n\r\nDelta howled and the goblin ran off, shrieking as the Orb crackling with energy.\r\n\r\n“ME GUARD DOOR!” it screamed with fear.\r\n\r\nDelta panted, feeling quite tired… she should… just… rest for a while.\r\n\r\nThe Orb seemed to agree and went dormant.\r\n\r\nDelta felt her head hit the floor and felt a twinge of pain.\r\n\r\nGood… that was still a thing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGoblin, until further notice, sighed with relief as the everlasting master of his new abode seemed to rest. He had been rather silly, suggesting he knew what the core, all hail its greatness, should do next.\r\n\r\nSuch arrogance on his part. Goblin watched the tunnel, not expecting any trouble. Surely, the great one would have traps ready. They must be so good, he couldn’t spot any sign of them!\r\n\r\nSuch a powerful master, so wise, so cunning.\r\n\r\nGoblin grinned and felt excited that he was one of the first, if he did well, perhaps he could receive a boss promotion...oh how much he desired such a lofty goal.\r\n\r\n“Me good boss,” Goblin said with pride.\r\n\r\nThat was when the entrance was breached by two more goblins. Runts, even a dungeon Goblin like himself could see it.\r\n\r\nThey squawked and begged for protection.\r\n\r\nGoblin bared his teeth, not wanting such riff-raff near his grandmaster and holy object. The goblins pleaded harder and voices came not far off.\r\n\r\nDeep ones, angry ones, eager ones.\r\n\r\nGoblin frowned. As wonderful as the great core was… being so fresh, it was not prepared for anything more than beasts…\r\n\r\nAt least that’s what the walls whispered to Goblin. His tie to the dungeon saying that Delta… the great one was not ready for this.\r\n\r\nSnarling, he grabbed both goblins and threw them down the tunnel.\r\n\r\nIf they hurried, they could make a bargain. A deal so soon was… well, he didn’t know. Deals with a dungeon core were handled with care, poise, elegance, intelligence, and with great thought.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDelta opened one bleary eye at the begging goblins making weird yowling noises.\r\n\r\nShe knew… somehow, that they wanted something.\r\n\r\n“Sure… whatever… let me sleep,” she mumbled and curled up to go back to slumber.\r\n\r\nShe did not see the glow that filled the two tiny goblins.\r\n\r\nNor did she see them grow and rip out of their old furs as muscles bulged and fangs grew.\r\n\r\nDelta dreamed and smiled as the great cake god blessed her with deserts.\r\n\r\nShe drooled as bloodshed filled her dungeon that very same day she was created.\r\n\r\nIt was a record for this world. Not that Delta would ever know.\r\n\r\n----\r\n');

('Smelting 2', 'Forge of Destiny', 2, 'As it turned out, Dong Fu was correct. The signs were quite clear. Only a handful of other silver robed youths remained in the wide open entrance hall as she entered, and none of them paid her any more than a passing glance.\r\n\r\nThe rear wall of the entrance hall was taken up by a massive board of ebony wood. A banner was strung up on the board, clearly delineating directions for new disciples. The spotlessly clean wooden interior of the building was honestly a little unsettling. It was unnatural; the floor was so polished that it was practically a mirror, and she couldn’t see a single scuff or mark anywhere, let alone a speck of dust.\r\n\r\nShe couldn’t give that too much thought, however, because she was one of the last ones in. As she arrived at the sliding doors marking the entrance to hall one, she could hear the murmur of a large number of people speaking quietly within.\r\n\r\nPeering inside, she could see that the large room was built with a series of long desks placed on descending tiers, broken up by shallow steps going down to the pit where the lecturer’s podium stood. The desks were almost completely full, and as she stepped inside, Ling Qi caught more than one curious, dismissive, or assessing look from the crowd of chattering fourteen year olds already present. It made her hackles rise; the feeling of condescending dismissal was an almost physical thing.\r\n\r\nGiving herself a shake, she forced herself to ignore it and search for empty seats.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious and first to draw her eye was a whole section which lay empty centered on a pale girl. The girl had snow white hair that fell freely down to the middle of her back and was everything Ling Qi was not: petite and dainty with almost supernaturally pale skin. She was whispering into the sleeve of her uniform, which had been personalized with a scale-like pattern in the embroidery. She seemed to be paying very little attention to her surroundings, yet she sat alone in an otherwise packed room.\r\n\r\nThe girl raised her head then, looking toward Ling Qi. Ling Qi felt her blood run cold for as she saw the other girl’s eyes, golden and slit pupiled. A shudder of animalistic fear rippled up her spine. The moment ended when the other girl broke eye contact and returned her attention to a bright green snake which had just poked its head out of her sleeve.\r\n\r\nWhat was that? She had felt like a mouse in front of a serpent, yet the girl’s expression hadn’t even been hostile nor condescending, just indifferent.\r\n\r\nLing Qi quickly turned her attention to the other possible seats. There was another girl who had a seat open next to her. She was leanly muscled with sun-darkened skin and bright red hair woven into a single braid. The splash of color stood out amidst the rest of the room.\r\n\r\nStrangely, she was wearing a partial boys uniform: a pair of baggy pants rather than a robe and a silken sleeveless shirt. Ling Qi might have thought her a feminine boy if not for how… stretched the shirt she wore was. Unlike the others, who were seated with meticulous posture, she sat with her feet propped on the desk in front of her and a bored expression on her face. Her gaze briefly flickered Ling Qi\'s way before the laid back girl seemed to dismiss her as unimportant.\r\n\r\nFurther down, there was an open seat adjacent to the steps next to a tall boy, tall enough that she wouldn’t be looking down at him if they stood face to face. He was… well, a little handsome Ling Qi could admit, in the classical way, with noble features and good proportions. But not girlish, the way some nobles and wealthy sorts could get.\r\n\r\nMainly, her attention was drawn by the gold furred tiger cub curled up on top of his head. She stared for a moment, but no one else seemed to think it odd. When he noticed her look, the boy gave her a friendly smile and a slight nod that made the cub on his head growl unhappily.\r\n\r\nThe last available seat was in the room’s far corner next to a short young man with with shaggy brown hair and a rather nasty burn scar extending across his right cheek, down his neck, and under his shirt. It was quite ugly, and it took a moment to pull her eyes from the scar to look at the rest of him. He was of middling height and compact build. Just from a glance, she would guess him to be one of the few others in this room to be of the same… social class as her. He certainly looked as out of place and uncomfortable as she felt.\r\n\r\nWhen he met her eyes, his gaze was measuring and wary. Her eyes skittered away immediately. He reminded her too much of Tonghou, and wasn’t she going to leave that behind?\r\n\r\nLing Qi glanced between the open seats, but in the end, the choice was obvious. Dong Fu’s advice still echoed in her ears, and… if she was honest with herself, she wanted to follow it.\r\n\r\nIt came down to loneliness in the end. If there was one thing Ling Qi’s effort to remain unconstrained had failed to give her, it was friends. Given Mother’s occupation, that pool had always been limited to begin with and living as she had for the last four years had not allowed her to spend a long time in anyone’s company.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, she chose the option that at least seemed friendly. She began to make her way down the stairs toward the handsome boy with the tiger cub at a sedate pace. Even if his friendliness was a facade, it was better than indifference or hostility.\r\n\r\nThat seemed to trigger most of those who had been looking at her askance to go back to their own conversations. Now that she had the opportunity to study them, Ling Qi could see that there seemed to be several cliques among those seated here. She was no socialialite, but she could see that there was no room for someone like her there.\r\n\r\nAs she came to a stop next to the desk where the boy was seated, she did her best to put her doubts and worries aside, but it was a difficult thing.\r\n\r\n“D’you mind if I sit here?” The words escaped her before she could really think about it, and she clenched her fists under her sleeves. She had been trying to remember to speak formally, but it wasn’t something that came naturally to her anymore. Now he was going to think she was…\r\n\r\n“Sure thing.” His laid back words cut off her internal panic. The boy shifted in his seat, moving over a bit to give her more room. The easy smile he gave her absolutely did not make her heartbeat speed up.\r\n\r\n“You were kinda cutting it close though, weren’t you?” He had a slight accent that she couldn’t place, which combined with his laid back attitude, seemed to draw his words out oddly.\r\n\r\nLing Qi hastily seated herself before too much attention could be drawn to her embarrassed flush. Not that most were likely to care, her more reasonable side would point out. She glanced up to find him regarding her with something like amusement.\r\n\r\nThe tiger cub curled up atop his head seemed to be sleeping again, and she briefly wondered how it hadn’t fallen when he’d turned his head to look at her.\r\n\r\n“My carriage only just arrived,” she responded, more defensively than she would have liked. She suddenly remembered that she hadn’t introduced herself yet.\r\n\r\n“I am Ling Qi by the way,” she said quickly. “If.. ah, you were wondering, I…” She hated the way her voice trailed off into awkward uncertainty. Let her slip through a busy street dipping her hands into pockets or stand up to a fence trying to swindle her, and she could be confident. Apparently, friendly conversation could make her composure crumble in moments.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, her damn hair was working its way loose again. She already had a few unruly strands drifting in front of her eyes.\r\n\r\nFor his part, the boy gave her an odd look out of the corner of his eye as she hunched her shoulders, feeling stupid.\r\n\r\n“Han Jian,” he said after a moment. “Nice to meet you. Can’t say I recognize the name. If your carriage just got here, you must be local so that makes sense. My tutors always complained about me not paying enough attention.” He says the last with a self-deprecating smile.\r\n\r\nHis easy acceptance eased the tension Ling Qi felt and allowed her to sit up straighter. Doing so made her notice that aside from Han Jian, she just might be the tallest person in the room. So much for standing out less.\r\n\r\nStill, the implied question made her feel awkward. Was he only being polite because he thought she might be someone of noble birth like him? He seemed almost too casual to be a noble though.\r\n\r\n“My family isn’t very important,” she decided to hedge. “Where are you from? I’m, I mean, I am not familiar with yours either.” She stumbled over the words more than she would have liked, but she felt that it was still a decent deflection.\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and Ling Qi felt the corners of her lips quirk up. It was hard to stay tense around him.\r\n\r\n“Guess we’re both a couple of slackers then,” he responded, sounding amused. “The Han family is from the Golden Fields province.” He seemed really amused but also… almost relieved?\r\n\r\nGolden Fields… the name was vaguely familiar as if she had heard it once a long time ago. It came to her then. Golden Fields was the easternmost province of the empire, and more importantly...\r\n\r\n“Oh, the Grave of the Sun. I didn’t think someone would come from so far away.” She trailed off as she noticed that his smile had gone rather stiff.\r\n\r\nDid she say something rude? The story of Lu Guanxi and his final stand was famous. He was one of the Empire’s greatest heroes. She couldn’t really think of a reason why mentioning the hero would offend him. Maybe his family had sent him away and he didn’t like being reminded of how far away he was?\r\n\r\nHe gave a slightly forced laugh. “Yeah, that’s the one. I guess most people only remember us for that old story these days.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi looked away awkwardly, pursing her lips. What had she said? She cast around for a change of subject to hopefully end the uncomfortable silence. Eventually, her eyes settled back on his pet, which she noticed had now opened its eyes and was staring down at her with the sort of imperious disdain that only a feline could manage.\r\n\r\n“So… where did you get your pet? I’ve never seen one like that.” Truly, she was a master of conversation and that wasn’t stilted at all.\r\n\r\nWhy did it feel like the little tiger cub was glaring at her now?\r\n\r\nHe blinked, but accepted the subject change. “I was introduced to Heijin by my Grandmother a few years back when I managed to awaken my qi. He’s not really a pet though, more like a little cousin.”\r\n\r\nWhat was that supposed to mean? Ling Qi had heard of some people treating their animals like family, so maybe he was just one of those. She was about to ask for clarification when a muffled boom cut through the buzz of conversation in the room.\r\n\r\nLike the others in the room, her attention was drawn to the source of the sound. It came from below where a tall, thin man had appeared at the lecturer’s podium. He was even now lowering his hands back to his side as if he had simply clapped for their attention.\r\n\r\nLing Qi frowned as she studied the man. There was something about him which set her on edge. Perhaps it was his almost unnaturally bland and thin features, clean shaven down to the eyebrows, or the slightly gray tone of his skin. If she didn’t know better, she would think him ill.\r\n\r\n...Or maybe it was the eye searing shades of pink and lilac he was garbed in. It was bizarre seeing what looked like the robes of a high minister in such an undignified shade. How had someone wearing such loud colors gotten past her like that? There was no door down there, so he must have come through the same entrance she had.\r\n\r\nShe glanced over at Han Jian, but he didn’t seem particularly surprised. She forced herself to relax a bit. It was some form of magic obviously, and not something which anyone else seemed concerned about though a few of the students had been startled out of their seats.\r\n\r\n“Welcome to the Argent Peak Sect, children,” the strange, bald man said as he clasped his hands behind his back. His expression was one of careful neutrality, but she thought she could see amusement twinkling in his grey… no, green, no… in his eyes, which seemed to rapidly change colors.\r\n\r\n“I am Sect Elder Sima Jiao, Head of the Talisman Department, and it seems that it is my turn to greet our new arrivals.” So this man was the one in charge of creating talismans like the spirit repelling totems placed around villages and cities? He must be incredibly wealthy. No wonder he could get away with dressing so outlandishly.\r\n\r\nThen she remembered the ridiculous hat her driver had worn. Perhaps becoming Immortal compelled one to dress strangely? While Ling Qi pondered the fashion sense of cultivators, Elder Jiao had clasped his hands behind his back and was giving her and the other students an assessing look.\r\n\r\n“I am terribly busy on the best of days so I will not ramble on. To be honest, it is likely that the majority of you will never amount to anything beyond the outer sect where you stand now, and are thus... not particularly worthy of my time.” His blithe dismissal drew a grumble from the gathered students, Ling Qi among them. Han Jian’s serene expression didn’t change though. Perhaps he was simply that confident. Seeing that, Ling Qi let out a breath, reigning in her irritation.\r\n\r\n“It is simply reality. Nothing to be ashamed of,” the Elder continued, not unkindly. “In any case, your first years here will serve the purpose of separating those with only minor potential from those with true talent. This is why no one will be allowed to leave the sect grounds during the first year, nor will any correspondence be allowed in or out in the first three months.”\r\n\r\nThat seemed to surprise some of the other disciples, setting off a wave of whispers, though no one dared to openly question the elder. It didn’t bother Ling Qi though. What did she have outside this place? Perhaps she would enjoy a stroll through her original home when she had made something of herself, but until then, why bother?\r\n\r\n“Be silent,” Elder Jiao said then, pulling her attention back to him. “You will have time enough for mortal concerns later. Today and in the future, you are disciples of the Argent Peak. The foundation you lay in the first steps of your path will shape the rest of your lives. There is no need for distractions from the outside world.” His odd, color-shifting eyes swept over the room as his stern expression softened back into the same easy amusement he showed at the beginning of his speech.\r\n\r\n“The only other rule is that you may not kill or permanently maim your fellow disciples nor may you damage or steal sect property. In addition, there is to be absolutely no violence between you newcomers for the first three months. Conflict is important for your growth, but it would not do to allow potential to be cut off before it can even begin to bloom.”\r\n\r\nHis words, delivered in a light tone still sent a chill down Ling Qi’s spine. It seemed things wouldn’t be so different from home after all. She found herself eyeing her fellows in a new light, as possible enemies and obstacles.\r\n\r\nLing Qi was brought up short only when she saw Han Jian giving her a reassuring smile. Only then did she noticed that her hands resting on the desk in front of her had clenched nervously. She did her best to return her current companion’s smile, but the expression was a little wan.\r\n\r\nIt was unlikely that she could rely on someone whom she had only shared a brief conversation with. She managed to calm herself after another few moments; worrying for her safety was nothing new. Besides, the Elder was speaking again, and she needed to pay attention.\r\n\r\n“Each of you will be granted an allowance of five red spirit stones per month and access to the Argent Soul Art,” he continued, confusing her. She had no idea what either of those things were.\r\n\r\n“For those of you not aware,” he added, “spirit stones are the currency of the Immortals, more valuable than gold or silver.” Ling Qi was suddenly all too aware of the way his unsettling gaze rested on her before passing to a handful of other students in the room.\r\n\r\n“Cultivation requires the consumption of the energy in said stones, at least until one masters certain other arts. I would suggest frugality. As for the Argent Soul Art, it is the beginners form of the Sect’s cultivation art. It is exceptional for early growth, if somewhat less effective for mature cultivators.” The older man rolled his shoulders then and glanced toward the door.\r\n\r\n“All of your mortal necessities will be provided in the Sect at no further cost. Behind this building are two paths leading to the residential areas. You will be segregated by gender, of course.” He smiled as if amused by some private joke. “I would not suggest trespassing in the wrong zone. Rooming arrangements will be up to you, but expect to room with at least one other disciple. For the first three months, two Elders will be on the mountain to provide beginner’s training in, the physical and spiritual aspects of our arts respectively. I suggest you seek them out because you will need to earn such elder attention later.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"All else will be up to you, your skill, and your talent.” He unclasped his hands and brought them back up to rest on the podium, but they were no longer empty. Instead, he held a large jewelry box made of dark green jade. “Now, if you would file up in an orderly fashion, I will be handing out your first month’s allowance.”\r\n\r\nAs she stood, preparing to join the forming line below, Han Jian spoke up quietly from beside her. He was now standing as well, and Ling Qi noted that she had been right. He was actually taller than her; it felt strange to look up at someone her own age. Heijin, his tiger cub had migrated from his head to his shoulder, clinging to the fabric with his…? little kitten claws. The tiger cub was still giving the impression of glaring at her.\r\n\r\n“Do you need a couple of pointers on getting started?,” he asked, sounding a bit awkward. “I couldn’t help but notice you aren’t actually awakened yet. You just seemed a little on edge, you know?” He followed Ling Qi as she stepped out into the aisle to join the line.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” Ling Qi responded after a moment. He had seemed friendly enough, and it wasn’t as if she had anything he could possibly want.\r\n\r\n“How would I contact you though?” Ling Qi asked.\r\n\r\nHe hummed thoughtfully as the line shuffled forward. “Hm, I’ll wait out in the front plaza here around noon tomorrow. That sound good? I’d rather not end up with last pick of the housing today.”\r\n\r\nShe supposed she didn’t have much choice in the matter. She nodded her assent and fell silent. Making conversation was more tiring than she thought.\r\n\r\nShe soon received her allowance of spirit stones and a scroll case containing her new ‘cultivation art’. No one had come out and said it, but she thought it likely that it was necessary for ‘awakening’ since they were giving it out to everyone. She would have to read it later, and practice. Perhaps she could surprise Han Jian come tomorrow? The thought was oddly pleasing.\r\n\r\nFor now though, Ling Qi thought as the line moved forward, she had to make sure that she would be able to keep these ‘gifts’. The first step to that would be seeing to her housing.\r\n'),
('Smelting 3', 'Forge of Destiny', 3, '\r\n\r\nThe glittering red stones were almost entrancing to look at, Ling Qi thought. Each one was the size of her thumb and had an odd warmth that was very pleasant. She stowed them away almost immediately.\r\n\r\nHaving what felt like such valuable precious stones on her person made her nervous. She really wished the gown she had been given had hidden pockets to it. Still, the Elder had forbidden all violence for the next three months, and while that normally wouldn’t be enough to make her relax, in this case, she had a feeling that it would actually be enforced.\r\n\r\nFiling outside, their group was quickly joined by the disciples from the other two lecture halls. The disciples moved toward the two mountain paths that lay behind the main hall. Each path was flanked by a pair of large stone pillars carved with many symbols centered around a single large character. The right hand set had the character for man; the left hand set had the character for woman. The meaning was rather obvious, and it seemed that no one had a desire to test the elders’ words today.\r\n\r\nWalking between the pillars gave Ling Qi an odd tingling sensation, making the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. It was unpleasantly like being watched, but thankfully faded as they moved further from the pillars. For now, she walked silently somewhere in the middle of the crowd of quietly chattering girls, clutching the strap of her satchel tightly and feeling terribly out of place. There were a bit over a hundred people in the group here. That meant that she had quite a few people to compete with if the implications of Elder Jiao’s statements were true.\r\n\r\nShe recognized a handful of the girls from her own lecture hall, mostly the two she had considered sitting with. The red haired girl strolled along at the head of the group, hands behind her head and looking for all the world like she was leading them despite simply walking in the same direction. The white haired girl was noticeable simply because of the ‘bubble’ of clear space around her as she walked with her head down toward the rear of the group. Many of the other girls had grouped into little chattering cliques already.\r\n\r\nReaching the crest of the hill, Ling Qi caught her first glimpse of the residences. Built at the bottom of a small ravine in the mountainside, the homes were set out in a neat grid with wide clean streets between them. At the far end was a veritable mansion, like something she would glimpse over the wall that separated the inner city from the outer back home. Smaller, but still nearly palatial homes with flowering gardens came next. Then came the stone homes that lacked gardens but looked like something a successful craftsman might own. Past that, there were tiny round hovels with straw roofs, barely big enough for two people.\r\n\r\nLing Qi peered over the residences with a determined look. To be frank, having a home at all was a luxury beyond her means so the quality didn’t necessarily concern her. However, given Elder Jiao’s words that she would likely end up rooming with someone, it meant there simply weren’t enough free homes.\r\n\r\nLing Qi took a calming breath as they began to make their way down the steep path that led to the residences. She was going to be in danger here once the brief period of enforced nonviolence ended. She would need to make an effort to keep herself safe.\r\n\r\nOne way was to gain strength herself, which was strange to think of as it had never really been an option before. A second method was following her driver’s advice and finding ‘someone to watch her back’. Han Jian… well, while she hoped he would turn out to be genuine, even if he was only pitying her, he couldn’t help her here on the girl’s side.\r\n\r\nShe really wasn’t good at this sort of thing. She had never joined any of the street gangs at home; she had no illusions about what her ‘role’ in such a group would have been. If she wanted that, she would have just stayed with Mother and at least made a living out of it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, she didn’t really have anything to offer at the moment though. Casting a surreptitious glance around at the other girls, she found it doubtful that she would be able to involve herself in any of their cliques. There were a few who seemed like they came from less wealthy backgrounds, including a strange girl with dirty smudges on her and wearing some kind of odd fluffy belt of fur around her waist. They wouldn’t be able to help keep her safe though because they had the same problem of having nothing to offer yet.\r\n\r\nSo her gaze went back to the two girls she had shared a lecture hall with. The white haired girl was a better choice to approach first she thought. A look around at the others showed that she was ostracized for some reason whereas the distance kept by the others around the red headed girl seemed more… respectful? Fearful might be a better word.\r\n\r\nAnother glance at the white haired girl solidified her resolve to approach. She had no real position so any approach was a gamble. She may as well try for someone who clearly had some kind of power but who wouldn’t have other options.\r\n\r\n... And honestly she felt a little bad watching the girl trudge along with her head down. She could recognize the defensiveness in the set of her shoulders.\r\n\r\nLing Qi began to drift closer to the girl, sidling through the gaps until she reached the empty space around the other girl. As she ‘broke’ the bubble, she noticed several of the girls nearby go quiet and one or two look her way.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the nervous feeling in the pit of her stomach, she pressed on until the girl she was approaching noticed her presence and looked up. She got a better look at the other girl’s face then.\r\n\r\nShe was unnaturally pale and had the fine features of a porcelain doll framed by silky white hair that fell down to the middle of her back. However, her thin lips were unpainted and bloodless, barely standing out from the rest of her skin, nor did she appear to be wearing any other cosmetics.\r\n\r\nMostly, it was her eyes that drew Ling Qi’s attention. The slit pupils and wide golden irises were unnerving, but despite the thrill of terror when their eyes met, Ling Qi did not look away or retreat as the fear made her want to do. It helped that the top of the girl’s head didn’t even reach Ling’s Qi’s shoulder. Instead, she nodded to the other girl and fell in beside her a few polite steps away.\r\n\r\n“Hello, I am Ling Qi.” Her voice was stiffer than she would have liked. Several beats of awkward silence followed as the white-haired girl stared at her expressionlessly without blinking. It was very off putting.\r\n\r\nWhen the girl didn’t respond, she asked, “May I have your name?”\r\n\r\nThat seemed to prompt the other girl to blink thankfully, though her expression was unchanged. It was difficult to read her, but she didn’t think the other girl was wary of her so much as… nonplussed at her presence.\r\n\r\n“Bai Meizhen of the Thousand Lakes province,” the girl responded by rotely. “Why did you not finish introducing yourself?”\r\n\r\nLing Qi glanced to the side, aware that she and the other girl were being surreptitiously watched. “I did,” she responded awkwardly. “I mean, I suppose I am from the Emerald Seas province,” she added hastily.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like trying to maintain formal speech patterns really was a lost cause. She doubted she could deceive the girl for any length of time anyway given her lack of knowledge about noble families. Was there a noble Ling clan?\r\n\r\nHer response ended in another painfully awkward silence, and Ling Qi shifted from foot to foot as the other girl stared at her. She really wished the other girl would blink more often.\r\n\r\nFinally, Bai Meizhen spoke again, a hint of confusion coloring her mostly toneless voice. “I… see. What is it you require then? I am afraid I have not been granted allowance to hire a maidservant.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi could not help but grit her teeth at the dismissal and the soft titter she caught from one of the closer girls… but she managed to calm herself. She had been insulted before and after the initial wave of irritation, she could see that there was no malice in the other girl’s words. It was more like she was just… completely lost on why else Ling Qi would be talking to her. So she pushed down her anger and put on a smile. She would just be blunt then.\r\n\r\n“I was actually thinking we could be friends. We’re both cultivators, right?” Cultivation was supposed to supersede bloodline and such, even if it seemed that might not be how it worked in practice. “You seem like you could use a friend, and we have to pair off for housing anyway.”\r\n\r\nThe odd girl tilted her head to the side slightly, her pace slowing as she observed Ling Qi with an odd intensity. Then her eyes shifted to the side as she frowned, pursing her lips as if listening to something. No one was talking to them as far as Ling Qi could tell.\r\n\r\n“I suppose that is acceptable,” Bai Meizhen responded after a moment longer. She didn’t seem particularly pleased or displeased with Ling Qi’s assertion of friendship, but that might have been the unsettling lack of emotional cues the girl gave.\r\n\r\n“I will warn you however. Do not approach me while I sleep. It is likely that you would die.” The white haired girl delivered that line in the same cold, even tone as the rest of her speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nLing Qi stared at Bai Meizhen trying to work out if that was meant as a threat, a warning, both or something else entirely. After a moment’s consideration, she forced herself to laugh. “I’ll keep that in mind. That would be pretty unfortunate, wouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\nThe other girl just dipped her head very slightly in acknowledgement. “It would be unpleasant to lose my first friend to something so avoidable,” she responded agreeably.\r\n\r\nLing Qi narrowed her eyes at the other girl, trying to work out if she was mocking her, but quickly gave up. Turning her eyes ahead as they resumed walking, she saw that they were a bit over halfway down the path.\r\n\r\n“I was thinking we might talk someone else into joining us. Safety in numbers, you know? Would you have a problem with that?”\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen seemed to consider that before briefly glancing down at her left arm. “It would likely be difficult to convince another to share a space with me. I do not object in principle though. Did you have someone in mind?”\r\n\r\nLing Qi glanced at the nearby girls, noting with a somewhat heavy heart, the disdainful looks she received in return. Cozying up to Bai Meizhen had earned her some residual dislike. Keeping her voice low so as not to carry, she nodded toward the front of the group. “That girl, the one with red hair, She’s alone too.”\r\n\r\nFor the first time, she saw something like actual emotion surface on Bai Meizhen’s face as her perfect eyebrows drew together in a look of bafflement. “You… wish to share a roof with her?” she asked, sounding somewhat incredulous.\r\n\r\nShe looked back and forth between Ling Qi and the redhead before something seemed to occur to her and make her consternation disappear. “That is the eldest great-granddaughter of Sun Shao, Sun Liling” she explained patiently, as if to a child.\r\n\r\nLing Qi bristled at the condescension, but she was fairly certain that Bai Meizhen meant well by it. She was hardly going to jeopardize her success at this juncture.\r\n\r\n“...Who?” she asked as politely as she could.\r\n\r\nThe other girl frowned at her, irritation flashing in her eyes. “The Butcher of the West.” Her frown only deepened at Ling Qi’s lack of recognition. “The Scarlet General. King of the Western Territories.”\r\n\r\nWell, that wasn’t ominous at all. She was at least aware of the Western Territories. It was a swathe of land on the western border of the Celestial Empire that had been conquered under the reign of the previous Emperor. As far as she knew, it was barely civilized and constantly under siege by barbarians.\r\n\r\n“What is someone like that doing here?” Ling Qi asked cautiously. Han Jian was from a far flung province as well, but he wasn’t a direct relation of the province’s ruler either.\r\n\r\n...He wasn’t, right? She might have to start learning more about this kind of thing.\r\n\r\n“I do not know. Her presence here is bizarre,” Meizhen replied simply.\r\n\r\nLing Qi felt oddly gratified to know her first thought on the matter was not entirely off base. “Still, is there a particular reason not to approach her?” If she were to approach her, she would need to do so soon as the group was nearing the entrance to the residential area.\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen shook her head. “Yes,” she replied flatly. “However, I will not stop you if you wish to go to her.” The pale girl gave her a measuring look, and something she couldn’t quite manage to read flashed through Bai Meizhen’s eyes. “You may have a chance, I suppose,” Bai Meizhen added impassively before turning her attention back to the path ahead.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m at least going to try and talk her into it,” Ling Qi said stubbornly. She stole another look at her companion, but the girl just nodded, her expression blank again. Ling Qi dipped her head to the other girl and strode forward, picking up her pace to move through the crowd.\r\n\r\nIt was a bit harder than before as she found herself blocked by seemingly oblivious girls, even jostled once or twice ‘accidentally’. She refused to rise to such bait for the moment. More uncomfortable was the way she could feel Bai Meizhen’s unwavering gaze on her back. Still, they weren’t walking particularly fast so even with such distractions, it didn’t take more than a minute to get up to the front of the group. She soon broke through the crowd, and after a moment’s hesitation, she continued forward toward the red haired girl.\r\n\r\n“You can stop right there.” Sun Liling’s voice brought her up short several steps away. The tanned girl had a pronounced rough accent, though thankfully, it didn’t make her words too difficult to understand.\r\n\r\n“Whaddaya want?” The other girl hadn’t even looked at her yet.\r\n\r\nUp close, Ling Qi could see the corded muscle in the other girl’s bare arms and the torn cloth where the redhead had ripped off the sleeves of her uniform. The girl was taller than most, only a few centimeters shorter than Ling Qi.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, Ling Qi got a better look at the way the girl moved, and it reminded her of the most dangerous people on the streets back home, the murderers and gang enforcers. Sun Liling had a grace that even they lacked however.\r\n\r\n “I was going to ask if you had decided who you were pairing up with for housing,” Ling Qi responded tentatively.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sun Liling deigned to turn her head slightly, not lowering the arms held behind her head. The pose made it difficult to ignore the fabric strained to near breaking across across her chest. Ling Qi managed it with only a minor spike of irritation, returning her attention to the other girl’s face.\r\n\r\nIt was disturbing to note that the other girl’s eyes were the color of freshly spilt blood. The most attention grabbing feature was the three, thin white lines that traced down across her nose and lips. It looked like something had raked it’s claws down her face.\r\n\r\n“The snake blow you off then?” She asked abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe other girl was making no effort to keep her voice down, and Ling Qi just managed not to squirm at the silence from the girls closest to them.\r\n\r\n“I… no.” She still stumbled over the words though. “How did you…”\r\n\r\n“I wanted to see what had the geese back there squawking,” Sun Liling drawled lazily. “I guess I gotta give you points for ambition if nothing else.” Ling Qi felt uncomfortable at the other girl’s intent study of her.\r\n\r\n“You don’t look completely soft. You might be worth something if you work at it.”\r\n\r\nIndignant, Ling Qi’s next words slipped out before she could think about it. “Don’t say that as if it’s praise,” she snapped.\r\n\r\n“I was...” Ling Qi’s eyes flew wide open wide as a scar nicked fist suddenly stopped a hair’s breadth from her nose, the blowback enough to make Ling Qi’s flyaway strands flutter from her face. The others behind them stopped dead in their tracks as well. She hadn’t even seen Sun Liling move into position. Sun Liling’s crimson eyes were hard and cold.\r\n\r\nThen, Sun Liling withdrew her fist and chuckled. “Made ya flinch,” she said in a voice laced with amusement. “But seriously, if you survive the inevitable backstab from the snake, I’ll still be around.”\r\n\r\nAs the girl turned away and kept walking, Ling Qi glared at her back, hating the flush of embarrassment that she knew was rising on her face. This time, she managed to control herself. Her heart was still pounding in her ears from the fear she had felt in that bare second when she had thought the other girl was going to strike her. She wasn’t an experienced fighter, but… she was quite certain she would be in no condition to walk anywhere if the girl had followed through.\r\n\r\nLing Qi fell back through the crowd, ignoring the looks she was getting and returned to Bai Meizhen’s side. There was a trace of… concern, maybe, on the pale girl’s face before vanishing.\r\n\r\n“Are you well?” the other girl asked evenly.\r\n\r\n“Fine,” Ling Qi responded tersely. With an effort, she fought down the indignation and anger she felt and let out a long breath. There was no point in it right now.\r\n\r\n“So,” she began with false cheer, “what kind of residence do you want to take?”\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen stared at her unblinking before dipping her head slightly, apparently acknowledging Ling Qi’s desire not to talk about it.\r\n\r\n“I do not feel the need to enter conflict over the more luxurious housing. However, the outer hovels are unacceptable.”\r\n\r\nAt least that was one thing she didn’t have to worry about. Ling Qi would have been happy enough to take one of the smallest homes if she were alone, but given the other girl’s words regarding the consequences of disturbing her rest, Ling Qi wouldn’t want to risk being in such close proximity when sleeping.\r\n\r\n“Somewhere in the second block then? That’s more than enough for me,” she replied, keeping her voice cheerful.\r\n\r\nLing Qi had suffered far worse than a threatened fist, and she had been foolish to let her emotions get the better of her. She couldn’t allow herself to forget the caution that had kept her alive for the past four years, no matter where she was now.\r\n'),
('Smelting 4', 'Forge of Destiny', 4, '\r\n\r\nThings grew rather more hectic as they reached the bottom of the path and the group splintered, various groups rushing off to secure their claims.\r\n\r\nFor Bai Meizhen and Ling Qi, things went rather smoothly though. For all that the other girls seemed to dislike Bai Meizhen, they also seemed reluctant to confront her directly and certainly not over one of the homes in the second section. So it was with some ease that the two of them managed to secure a fairly luxurious space for themselves, or so Ling Qi felt.  \r\n\r\nThe second worst homes in the Sect were still a step above any accommodation Ling Qi had ever lived in. The squat stone building was only a single story, but in addition to a fairly spacious front room with a well kept hearth, there were also a pair of bedrooms, a tiny kitchen, and a third empty room laid out with thick mats. It wasn’t furnished with any particular luxury: simple pallets and roughly carven chests for their belongings were the only contents of the bedrooms. It did have a small backyard filled with freshly trimmed grass.\r\n\r\nLing Qi separated from her new roommate to head into her bedroom and luxuriate in the fact that she had a personal bedroom. While she feared what might come in the days ahead, for the moment, she let herself enjoy the feeling of luxury.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to put her things away. The chest in one corner of the room was big enough to hold all of her meagre possessions - but she took the time to put it all away neatly and give herself a chance to process everything that had happened today.\r\n\r\nEventually, she found herself in the front room of the house with the sun setting outside. Ling Qi had discovered a sheet of paper on the kitchen’s countertop, which stated that food and drink would be provided from a storehouse at the center of the district. Having retrieved and cooked a simple meal, she was sitting in front of the fire while Bai Meizhen quietly tended to the tea she was brewing in the clay pot they had found in one of the kitchen cubbies.\r\n\r\nWith her now empty bowl set on the floor beside her, Ling Qi had the scroll for the Argent Soul technique open in her lap. She tried to decipher the odd diagram and the text around it, but it seemed no more than a collection of breathing exercises interspersed with flowery philosophical nonsense. It didn’t help that her ability to read was... rusty. She was beginning to feel irritated; she knew she was missing something, but couldn’t quite understand what.\r\n\r\nShe was pulled from her thoughts by the whistle of the tea kettle. As much as she wanted to figure this out on her own… she should probably ask.\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen had made no indication that she was willing to help her, but after spending most of the afternoon together to collect necessities for their home, Ling Qi felt that she was beginning to get a feel for the taciturn girl. Asking for help was probably against Bai Meizhen’s nature, as was offering help on her own initiative, but Ling Qi could ask.\r\n\r\n“Bai Meizhen, do you know what this part means?” she asked, pointing to a block of characters next to a line pointing toward the navel of the human figure covered in lines and squiggles in the diagram.\r\n\r\nThe other girl took a moment to look up from the brewing tea, looking faintly surprised that Ling Qi was speaking to her. She didn’t really engage verbally unless prompted. She did lean forward, narrowing her creepy golden eyes to study the scroll, which Ling Qi helpfully turned to make easier for her.\r\n\r\n“It is describing the state of mind one must reach to begin absorbing spiritual energy into one’s dantian,” she responded a bit condescendingly. “It is the initial step in the simple exercises for the first stage of the technique once you have mastered the first breathing method.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi let out a breath, not letting the other girl’s tone bother her. The other girl didn’t mean any harm and was being helpful.\r\n\r\n“What is a dantian exactly?” Ling Qi asked, keeping her tone even. She hated even more that she felt she earned the condescension with her ignorance.\r\n\r\nBai Meizhen frowned, pausing as she poured herself a cup of the newly brewed tea. “It is the seat of a cultivator’s power, the core from which you channel energies through the meridians in your body. Filling the dantian is required to awaken and begin production of your own Qi.” She paused for a beat to stare at Ling Qi. “Qi is the energy which allows us to do… everything beyond the ability of mortals.”\r\n\r\n“I know that much,” Ling Qi responded defensively. “But how am I supposed to feel something inside of me like it says? It’s not like I can sense any of my other organs.”\r\n\r\nThe pale girl pursed her lips in consideration. “Give me your hand,” she said brusquely, holding out her own left hand.\r\n\r\n“Why?” Ling Qi glanced at the girl’s hand suspiciously. She could see the movement of the small snake she had glimpsed in the girl’s sleeve a few times by now.\r\n\r\n“I will inject a spark of Qi into you,” Bai Meizhen responded impatiently. “It will hurt, but it will allow you to feel your dantian until it fades. You will need to practice in the future to avoid the need for such crutches though.”\r\n\r\n“How much pain are we talking about?” Ling Qi asked warily, even as she raised her hand. She knew everything depended on her being able to gain enough strength to defend herself by the end of three months. She was still suspicious and some part of her railed against so easily trusting the girl in front of her not to hurt her… but could she afford that right now? Leaps of faith were all she had.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs her housemate took her hand, Bai Meizhen answered, “It is painful, but my Aunt did this for me when I was eight years old. It should be no trouble for you.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi was about to respond when she felt a sudden heat in her palm, followed by an explosion of pain in her gut. It felt as if a burning knife had stabbed into her and then violently twisted, and she couldn’t help but double over clutching her stomach. A slight whimper escaped her lips as she felt her eyes beginning to water. She didn’t know how long it was until the burning pain faded to a knot of heat behind her navel, throbbing like a second heartbeat. Was this the ‘dantian’ the other girl had mentioned?\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Bai Meizhen, she was observing Ling Qi quizzically over the lip of her teacup, and Ling Qi noted absently that a second cup had been placed before her. Letting out a shuddering breath, Ling Qi sat up, one hand still held over her stomach.  \r\n\r\n“That… that was more than painful,” she rasped, glaring at the other girl.\r\n\r\n“Was it?” the pale girl asked, seeming genuinely surprised. Ling Qi didn’t know if she was misreading the other girl’s cues though.\r\n\r\n“My apologies. You can feel the dantian now though, correct?”\r\n\r\n“I can,” Ling Qi admitted grudgingly.\r\n\r\n“You should drink your tea then meditate while it lasts,” Bai Meizhen said evenly. “Otherwise, it will have been for nothing.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi slugged back the tea in her cup, grimacing at the gross, bitter flavor of it then moved to stand, loosely clutching the scroll in her hand. She was still irritated and wary that she was being messed with. Sun Liling’s words echoed in her thoughts. For now, she was determined to at least try and reach this ‘awakening’.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been strange.\r\n\r\nLing Qi had never liked sitting still for too long before, but after she had shut the thick door to the meditation room and sat down to practice breathing as the scroll instructed, she found that her mind did not wander nearly as much as she expected it would. Rather, she seemed to fall into the pattern that the scroll described with ease as if she had been doing it for years.\r\n\r\nWhen she felt she had it down, she removed one of the glimmering red stones from her pocket and held it in her hands clasped in front of her stomach. She focused on the warmth of the stone and the throbbing pain in her abdomen and cast away her thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe heat was all that mattered. Her body, the cold stone room - none of it mattered. Just the pulse of pain in her belly and the heat in her hands.\r\n\r\nShe was still empty.\r\n\r\nPainfully so. The heat of the stone was her only hope for filling the void she could now feel.\r\n\r\nShe focused on her breathing and began to pull in time with her breath. The energy in the stone began to move, cresting and ebbing in time with her breath, until finally, it began to flow inwards. It trickled into the slowly fading knot of pain Bai Meizhen had given her.\r\n\r\nSlowly, she replaced that unpleasant sensation with a comfortable warmth. It was frustrating; something was blocking the energy from entering her body and much of the energy dispersed into the air instead of being absorbed.\r\n\r\nWhen she opened her eyes and found the room dark, she felt oddly refreshed. She didn’t think she had ‘awakened’ yet, but she could feel the warm steady pulse of the spiritual energy now. In contrast, the stone in her hand had turned gray and lifeless. Rubbing it between her fingers thoughtfully, she watched as it crumbled into dust.\r\n\r\nShe stood and stretched then quietly left the room. She felt better than she had in years, and despite some initial setbacks… she felt like she could do this.\r\n');

('Stars Fell', 'Mother of Learning', 4, '“I’m coming, I’m coming,” Zorian grumbled, stomping towards the door. Really, what’s with all the frantic knocking? Who exactly was so desperate to get into his room? He wrenched the door open and found himself staring at Akoja’s disapproving face. “Ako? What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“I should be asking you that,” she said. “Why are you still at home? The dance is-“\r\n\r\n“Two hours away,” Zorian interrupted. “I can get to the dance hall in 10 minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Honestly Zorian, why do you always have to wait for the last possible moment to do something? Don’t you realize what a bad example you’re setting?”\r\n\r\n“Time is precious,” Zorian said. “And I will repeat my question: what are you doing here? I don’t think it’s your usual habit to seek people out when they’re not early enough for your tastes.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Zileti told me to get you,” Akoja admitted.\r\n\r\nZorian blinked. It seems Ilsa wanted to make sure he didn’t ‘forget’. Hah. While the idea had occurred to him, he knew that would never fly.\r\n\r\n“She also said you couldn’t find a date, so that will be me for the evening,” Akoja continued in a more subdued tone, suddenly finding the doorframe interesting enough to merit examination.\r\n\r\nZorian scowled. How does ‘refuse to bring a date’ become ‘couldn’t find a date’? It seemed that Ilsa, like his mother, had a tendency to ‘translate’ his words into whatever was most convenient to her purposes. The two of them would get along quite well, Zorian suspected.\r\n\r\n“Anyway, get dressed so we can go already,” she said, suddenly regaining her confidence. “You might be alright with cutting things close, but I’m not.”\r\n\r\nZorian stared at her for a full second, trying to decide what to do. He was half-tempted to slam the door in her face and refuse to participate in this farce, but he supposed it wasn’t Akoja’s fault that she got roped into this. In all likelihood she had more pleasant plans for the evening than accompanying a surly boy who loathed the experience. He shooed her into the room and went into the bathroom to get dressed.\r\n\r\nHe really had to marvel at Ilsa’s manipulation skills, though – if it was just him going to this thing, he would have come dressed in casual clothes, spent the absolute minimum of time there before leaving, and avoided people like a plague throughout the entire evening. Now? He didn’t want to ruin Akoja’s evening, which meant he would have to make at least a token effort. Yes, Ilsa and his mother would get along like two peas in a pod…\r\n\r\nThe walk to the dance hall was a quiet one. Zorian refused to strike up a conversation, despite sensing that Akoja found the silence awkward. The silence suited him just fine, and he knew he would be comfortable with very few things this evening. He would enjoy the peace while it lasted.\r\n\r\nWhich wasn’t long – the hall that the academy set aside for this event was about 10 minutes away from his residence building. The moment they approached it they were greeted with the sight of a large gathering in front of the entrance, full of excited students engaged in animated discussions.\r\n\r\nZorian paled a little at the sight of the dense throng – he was getting a headache just by looking at them.\r\n\r\nSadly, no matter how much he pleaded with Akoja, she refused to let them wait on the outskirts of the gathering until the start of the dance. As revenge, Zorian ‘accidentally’ managed to get separated from Akoja when they were ushered inside and got himself lost in the crowd. He chuckled to himself, wondering how long it would take her to find him again. He’d be shocked if it was less than half an hour, since he was quite adept at avoiding the notice of a particular person at a party without drawing attention from the other party goers.\r\n\r\nFor a supposedly simple school dance, the entire event was surprisingly lavish. The tables were overflowing with food, much of it so exotic that Zorian couldn’t identify it, and the hall was decorated with high-quality paintings and animated carvings that moved in a pre-programmed manner. Hell, even the tablecloths were full of complicated lace and so soft they had to have been made of something monstrously expensive. Many of his fellow students were openly gaping at their surroundings and even Zorian, who had been at these kinds of events many times before, was a little shocked. Then he shrugged and did his best to blend into the crowd so Akoja couldn’t find him.\r\n\r\nHe meandered through the tables overflowing with food, occasionally sampling one of the dishes when he saw something interesting, observing the other people and painstakingly avoiding notice from anyone who might be inclined to strike up a conversation with him. He could see why Ilsa was so determined to make everything about the dance run smoothly – the sheer expense of the thing aside, it wasn’t just the students that were present. There were also representatives from various guilds, Houses, societies, and organizations. And not just from the Alliance, but also from abroad, even other continents – he could see at least one man in the distinctive light blue Abnazia military uniform, a small delegation from Hsan, and a dark-skinned woman in a garb so colorful Zorian doubted anyone failed to notice her by now. He idly wondered what this dance was really about, since these people wouldn’t be here for a simple school dance, before deciding he didn’t really care. People like this lived in their own world, and had different standards of ‘important’ from mere mortals like him.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the first dance was about to start and Zorian made his way to Akoja. She was fuming, and didn’t appear to believe him when he claimed he had honestly gotten lost and couldn’t find her until now, but she managed to restrain herself from blowing up at him. He led her to the dance floor and didn’t retaliate when she ‘accidentally’ stepped on his toes a couple of times.\r\n\r\n“People were asking for you,” she said finally, having tired of abusing his toes for the moment.\r\n\r\n“Well I was around,” Zorian said with a small smirk. “All they had to do was look for me.”\r\n\r\n“No reason why you can’t seek them out now, though,” Akoja remarked.\r\n\r\n“But Ako, we’re dancing. There is no way I’d leave a beautiful girl like you for anything. I’ve left you unattended for too long as it is,” Zorian said, not a trace of mocking in his voice. It was a practiced skill.\r\n\r\nShe glared at him, but Zorian could see she liked the compliment.\r\n\r\nSadly, it didn’t stop her from dragging him off to meet one group of people after another soon afterwards. Zorian hated being put on display like that, but he suspected Akoja was under orders from Ilsa, so he didn’t snap at her. He was surprised his stalling had worked for as long as it did, really. Zorian found himself memorizing various faces, names, and titles, despite not caring much. It was instinctive to him by now, and he did it even when he didn’t mean to – the legacy of his family’s failed attempt to turn him into a party animal.\r\n\r\n“Kazinski? Oh, are you by chance related to-“\r\n\r\n“Daimen and Fortov Kazinski, yes,” Zorian said, doing his best to keep the annoyance out of his voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh my, how fortunate,” she said. “I must say your brother isn’t half bad with the violin.” She gestured towards the stage, where the academy music club was playing a slow, relatively quiet song. Fortov was officially an ordinary orchestra member, but was obviously the most prominently placed musician on the stage. His presence, as usual, attracted attention and comments. “What instrument do you play?”\r\n\r\n“None,” Zorian deadpanned. His family had tried to teach him how to play an instrument, since it was a fashionable thing to learn among the rich (and those pretending to be), but were thwarted by the fact that Zorian was almost entirely tone-deaf. He had no ability to play music at all. Truth be told, he wasn’t particularly interested in it either, though he could certainly feign interest when doing so was polite. It was one of his mother’s bigger disappointments that he had no talent in this area, since Daimen and Fortov were both relatively decent at music – Daimen at playing the piano and Fortov at playing the violin. They weren’t prodigies by any means, but they were skilled enough to impress the kind of people that frequented events like this. “I don’t have much of an ear for music, unlike my brothers. Personally, I’m more interested in how the orchestra fills the entire hall evenly with sound, with everyone hearing them at the right volume, regardless of how near or how far they’re sitting in relation to the stage.”\r\n\r\nSadly, neither the woman nor anyone else gathered around them could answer that question – apparently nobody else even noticed it until he mentioned it. In fact, Zorian got a distinct notion that people felt it was an irrelevant detail and that he was weird for even mentioning it. Bah – no appreciation for magic from these people. Why were they attending a dance at a mage academy, again?\r\n\r\nThankfully, Akoja decided to have mercy on him at this point and led them to a nearby table to get something substantial to eat. A couple of other students from their class joined them and a casual conversation settled in around them. Zorian didn’t contribute much, since he found the conversation to be mostly aimless drivel that was of no interest to him. He still nodded and chuckled at appropriate times, of course, brushing off an occasional comment about him being ‘too quiet’ and needing to ‘lighten up’.\r\n\r\nHe was just about to dig into the piece of cake in front of him when Akoja nudged him with her knee. He glanced at her with an unvoiced question.\r\n\r\n“Wrong fork,” she mumbled.\r\n\r\nZorian looked down at the fork in his hand and realized he was supposed to use the tiny fork reserved for desserts. He shrugged and stabbed the cake with the giant fork in his hand anyway.\r\n\r\n“I know,” he mumbled back.\r\n\r\nThat seemed to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.\r\n\r\n“Zorian,” she burst out, her voice carrying a pleading note in it. “Why are you being so difficult? It’s just one night. I know I’m not what you wanted for your date…”\r\n\r\n“It’s not that,” Zorian interrupted her. “It’s not like I wanted a date, anyway. I was going to come alone to this thing.”\r\n\r\nShe stared at him in shock. She seemed emotionally crushed, and Zorian didn’t understand why.\r\n\r\n“Y-You’d rather go alone than with m-me?” she asked.\r\n\r\nAw crap.\r\n\r\nAll this time he thought Akoja was roped into this to keep an eye on him, but what if she had wanted to go with him? That…\r\n\r\nShe fled before he could figure out something to say.\r\n\r\nHe swore under his breath and buried his face in his hands. This is why he hated these kind of events.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nAn hour later he was pretty sure Akoja was no longer in the dance hall and that she wasn’t going to come back. He didn’t really want to chase her through the streets in the middle of the night, so he refrained from following her outside. Besides, what was he supposed to say to her? He wouldn’t know where to even start. He thought about going home himself, but in the end he simply climbed up onto the roof of the dance hall and observed the stars. He wasn’t going to get much sleep tonight, anyway.\r\n\r\nTo keep his mind occupied, he silently named all the stars and constellations he could see. Due to his interest in the topic as a child and the Astronomy class they had in their first year at the Academy, he knew quite a bit. It was a full hour before he ran out of things to name and describe.\r\n\r\nMonday was going to be awkward. Zorian had no doubt their little drama was overheard and would be the topic of conversation for several weeks to come. Considering that Akoja was a bit of a teacher’s pet in most of the subjects, the teachers could very well decide to make his life more difficult in the days to come as well.\r\n\r\nDamn it all.\r\n\r\nIt was the sound of fireworks that broke him out of his thoughts. It was midnight apparently, and the festival had officially started. Zorian relaxed a little as he watched various fireworks blossom against the night sky, each exploding in its own unique way. It was beautiful. Most of them dissolved into quickly fading motes of light after the initial explosion, but a couple of them remained whole and consistently bright, more like flares than fireworks. They arced through the sky before dipping down and falling back to earth like falling stars. He frowned. Weird. Shouldn’t they be exploding by now?\r\n\r\nThe flare falling closest to him slammed into the nearby academy residence building and detonated. The explosion was so loud and so bright that Zorian was momentarily blinded and deafened, stumbling back and collapsing to his knees as the entire building shook beneath his feet.\r\n\r\nBlinking spots out of his vision, his ears still ringing from the sound of the explosion, Zorian scrambled back to his feet. He stared at the spot where the stricken residence building once stood. Virtually the entire building had been leveled to the ground, everything flammable in the vicinity of the impact site was burning, and strange flaming shapes were emerging from the epicenter of the destruction.\r\n\r\nWait a minute… that’s his residence building!\r\n\r\nHe collapsed to his knees again as the implications of this hit him. If he had opted to stay in his room like he had originally planned, he’d have been dead right now. It was a sobering thought. But what the hell was happening here!? That was no firework, that’s for sure! It looked and sounded more like a high level artillery spell.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to tell if it was simply a consequence of his hearing being damaged, but he noticed the faint sounds of celebration had stopped. Looking over the city he noticed that what happened to the residence building wasn’t an isolated occurrence – wherever one of the flares hit, it left devastation in its wake. He only had a few seconds to ponder this before he noticed another batch of flares start ascending into the sky from the distance. This particular barrage was not masked by fireworks, so it was pretty obvious that they were artillery spells. They were under attack.\r\n\r\nAs the flares started dropping back to earth, Zorian began to panic. What the hell was he supposed to do!? Running away would be pointless since he didn’t know what the flares were targeting. He could very well be running straight into the area of effect if he ran blindly. Wait a minute, why does he have to do anything? There are a bunch of capable mages in the building, he should just notify them and have them handle it. He rushed down into the dance hall.\r\n\r\nHe had barely stepped on to the stairway when he ran into Ilsa and Kyron.\r\n\r\n“Zorian! What are you doing here?” Ilsa demanded.\r\n\r\n“Err, I just went out for some fresh air,” Zorian fumbled. “But that’s not important right now!”\r\n\r\n“I agree,” Kyron said. “Kid, what was that blast? Don’t tell me this is something you did?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly,” Zorian said. “Some kind of flares are falling all over the city, destroying everything they hit. Looks like some kind of powerful artillery spell.”\r\n\r\nIlsa and Kyron shared a look between each other before turning back to him.\r\n\r\n“Go join Akoja and the others in the dance hall,” Ilsa told. “We’ll see what is happening and teleport everyone into the shelters if necessary.”\r\n\r\nThe both pushed past him and rushed to the roof, leaving Zorian to stumble into the dance hall in a daze. Akoja… Akoja wasn’t in the dance hall. She left. Because of him. She was out there, maybe even already dead…\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and banished such thoughts out of his mind. He took out his divination compass and quickly cast a divination spell to locate her. He wasn’t sure if it was going to work, since the spell he used could only find people you were ‘familiar with’ – in other words, friends and family. Thankfully, it seemed that being classmates with her was enough of a connection for the spell to work.\r\n\r\nHe took a deep breath to steel his nerves. He was liable to get himself killed, but… well, it was kind of his fault. He didn’t think he could live with himself if Akoja ended up dead because of him.\r\n\r\nLike an intangible ghost, he weaved between agitated students and foreign dignitaries, ignored and unhindered, until he was near the exit. He slipped out of the building and then broke into the run in the direction indicated by the needle of his divination compass.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nTrolls were pretty nasty creatures. There were several subspecies, but all of them were large 3-meter tall humanoids with tough leathery skin and supernatural regenerative abilities so strong they were able to reattach severed limbs simply by holding them to the matching stump for a few moments. The most numerous and famous subspecies was the forest troll, which had vivid green skin and roamed throughout the great forested expanse in the north. As Zorian watched a troupe of trolls strut through the streets, smashing windows and howling unintelligibly, he reflected that it was fortunate the acrid smoke wafting from the nearby burning buildings masked his scent. His textbooks all said a forest troll’s sense of smell was frighteningly good.\r\n\r\nNormally he would have wondered what such a large gathering of forest trolls was doing in the middle of a human city, relatively far away from their native lands, but the blades and maces they were holding told him all he needed to know. Those were weapons too advanced to have been produced by the trolls themselves, who were highly primitive and lacked such high metal working skills. They were war trolls. Somebody armed these creatures and set them loose on the city.\r\n\r\nOnce they were gone, Zorian relaxed a little and tried to figure out what to do. He was such an idiot. Why, oh why did he have to run off without getting some help from the teachers first? Then again, he assumed the flares were the only danger, in which case getting to Akoja wouldn’t be an issue, assuming a stray flare didn’t get him. Instead he found the city overrun with monsters. This wasn’t some kind of a terrorist attack like he assumed, it was a full-blown invasion! Sadly, the option to return to the dance hall was closed to him – a lot of the invading forces were converging towards the academy, cutting off his retreat path. With that in mind, Zorian set out towards Akoja. He kept himself in the shadows, knowing the invaders would quickly notice anyone caught in the open, such as that boy standing… over… there…\r\n\r\nIs that Zach?\r\n\r\n“Over here!” Zach shouted, waving his hand in the air. “I’m over here you stupid animals! Come and get me!”\r\n\r\nZorian gaped at the reckless stupidity of what he was witnessing. What the hell was that idiot doing!? No matter how talented a student he was, there was no way Zach could stand up to the sort of monstrosities that were stalking the city at the moment. But it was too late to do anything – attracted by Zach’s shouting, the trolls came running back, giving a single collective battle cry before charging at the boy foolish enough to attract their attention. Zorian could tell from Zach’s posture that he intended to fight the trolls, which he thought was pretty crazy – what could he do against a creature that regenerates from virtually any wound done to it? Only fire and acid could do permanent harm, and they didn’t-\r\n\r\nZach grasped his staff firmly in his hand, his other hand outstretched in the direction of the charging trolls – a roaring fireball erupted from his hand and exploded right in the middle of the troll formation. When the flames cleared, only charred corpses remained.\r\n\r\nZorian was shocked. A proper fireball like that was a 3rd circle spell, and required a sizable amount of mana to cast, much more than any academy student had. Even Daimen could not have cast that spell when he was Zach’s age. Yet not only had Zach successfully done it, he didn’t even appear drained from the action. Indeed, when a flock of iron beaks attacked soon after, raining their deadly feathers at the boy, Zach simply erected an aegis – a freaking aegis! – around himself and peppered the birds with tiny fireballs that homed in on their targets, like magic missiles made out of fire. Zorian was transfixed by the sight of his classmate effortlessly fighting off hordes of monsters single-handedly. So much so that he almost failed to notice one of the winter wolves attacking Zach had stealthily broken off from the main pack and was sneaking up on him. Almost. Thankfully, some primal instinct alerted him to the danger and he threw himself to the side, narrowly avoiding the creature’s deadly pounce.\r\n\r\nZorian cursed himself as he watched the winter wolf reorient itself with startling ease for something so large, ready for another pounce. He really should have expected to be targeted, considering the amount of attention Zach was drawing to himself. He should have used Zach’s fighting as a distraction and fled while he had the chance. Now it was too late - Zorian knew he was not fast enough to outrun a winter wolf, and he had no combat spells with which to defend himself. Or rather, no spell rods and such. If he survived the evening, he would definitely learn a few combat invocations, obsolete as they may be. It was a big if, though.\r\n\r\nA shining bolt of force slammed into the winter wolf’s head, causing it to explode in a gory mess of blood and bone fragments. Zorian didn’t know whether to be disgusted that he was showered by some of the bloody mess or relieved he would live for a little while longer. He also noted that the effects of the bolt were a bit strong for a regular magic missile. He supposed this was just another example of Zach’s baffling proficiency with combat magic.\r\n\r\n“Zorian? What the hell are you doing here?”\r\n\r\nZorian looked at Zach speculatively. Noticing the trail of corpses left in the other boy\'s wake, Zorian eyed the staff in his right hand and the belt full of spell rods. For all his seeming recklessness, Zach certainly came prepared. He was half tempted to ask the boy the very same question, but decided that would be needlessly antagonistic. Zach did just save his life, after all. He decided to go for honesty – maybe the other boy would be willing to help him get to Akoja, considering his awe-inspiring fighting skills.\r\n\r\n“Searching for Akoja. She left the dance a while before the attack and it’s kind of my fault.”\r\n\r\nZach groaned. “Man, and I even went to the trouble of making sure you go to the dance, too. It’s like you want to get killed or something!”\r\n\r\n“You?” asked Zorian incredulously. “You’re the one that told Ilsa I wasn’t planning to go? All this time I’ve blamed Benisek! How did you even know about it?”\r\n\r\n“You always stay in your room and get killed in the initial barrage if I don’t do something to stop it. And let me tell you, convincing you not to stay in your room without resorting to violence or getting Ilsa involved is a damn chore. You can really be a stubborn ass when you want to be,” Zach said with a sigh.\r\n\r\nZorian stared at him, confused. The way Zach was talking, you’d think this kind of thing happens every day or something!\r\n\r\n“But enough of that,” said Zach cheerfully. “Let’s go find Akoja before something eats her. You know the way?”\r\n\r\nAnd so they did. They traveled through the burning streets of the city, leaving a trail of dead invaders behind them. Zach didn’t even try to avoid the monsters, simply plowing through them like an angry god out for vengeance. At one point they were even attacked by a horde of skeletons and an enemy mage, but Zach simply made the earth beneath their feet open up and swallow them. Zorian dutifully kept his mouth shut and never questioned Zach about his seemingly inexhaustible mana reserves or his knowledge of advanced magic that should be beyond his access level and proficiency, content to enjoy the benefits of Zach’s skill and talent. He would never have come this far without Zach’s help, and he was honestly grateful for the boy’s assistance. Zach could keep his secrets, whatever they were.\r\n\r\nThey eventually found Akoja barricaded in the upper floor of one of the houses. Apparently she was chased there by a pack of winter wolves and then refused to leave for fear that the creatures were waiting for her to come out. Smart, really. Smarter than what Zorian had done, that’s for sure. Fortunately, there was no trace of winter wolves around the house at this point – not that Zach was likely to have had any trouble with them if they were present – so they moved to the slightly frustrating task of convincing Akoja that it was safe to unbarricade the door. Apparently her experience with the winter wolves had shaken her up pretty badly.\r\n\r\nZorian was certain she would blame him for causing her to leave the safety of the dance hall, so he was quite surprised when Akoja immediately latched onto him when she finally opened the door, hugging him and sobbing into his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I thought I was going to die!” she wailed. “There were these huge birds flinging iron feathers everywhere and the winter wolves and…”\r\n\r\nZorian opened his mouth in confusion, unsure how to deal with such an emotional outburst. He shot Zach a pleading look, but the boy merely grinned at him cheekily, apparently amused by the reaction.\r\n\r\n“Ah, young love,” Zach nodded to himself knowingly. “But I’m afraid you’ll have to continue your heart-felt reunion back in the shelters.”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” Akoja shouted immediately, raising her face out of Zorian’s shoulder. She totally ignored Zach’s jab about them being in love, though Zorian suspected it was because she hadn’t even heard that part. She was still clutching his torso with an iron grip, as if afraid he’d disappear if she let go. It was kind of painful but he refrained from telling her so. “The shelters! We’ll be safe there!”\r\n\r\nZach flinched back for a moment before catching himself. It was so quick Akoja didn’t appear to have noticed, but Zorian did. So the shelters weren’t safe either? But apparently they were still safer than where they were right now, because Zach appeared determined to go through with it.\r\n\r\n“Great!” said Zach cheerily, clapping his hands in satisfaction. He took one of the spell rods out of his belt and handed it to Akoja. “You hold on too, Zorian.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” Zorian asked suspiciously. The rod had none of the markings that might identify what it was for, which made Zorian a bit leery of it. Using unknown magical objects without identifying what they’re for was a big no-no if you wanted to remain healthy and alive into your old age.\r\n\r\n“It’s a teleport rod,” Zach said. “It’s programmed to transport whoever is holding it to the shelters. I’ve set it to a 30 second delay, so hold it before you’re left behind.”\r\n\r\n“But what about you?” Akoja asked. “You need to hold on too before it activates!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no,” Zach said, waving her off. “I still have unfinished business here.”\r\n\r\n“Unfinished business!?” Akoja protested. “Zach, this isn’t a game! These things are going to kill you!”\r\n\r\n“I’m perfectly capable-“\r\n\r\nZorian wasn’t sure what tipped him off, exactly – he just got a vague feeling of dread and knew he had to react immediately, much like what happened when the winter wolf tried to get a jump on him earlier. Wrenching himself free from Akoja’s grip with a sudden jerk, he pushed Zach out of the way of the incoming spell. An angry red ray surged through the air in front of them, passing right where Zach’s head was only a few moments ago, and hit the wall behind them. The jagged beam of red light bit deep into the wall, gouging a deep trench in it and shrouding the area in a cloud of fine dust.\r\n\r\n“Crap,” Zach said. “He found me. Quick, hold the rod before-“\r\n\r\nAkoja winked out of existence as the rod teleported her away to safety.\r\n\r\n“-it activates,” finished Zach in a long-suffering tone. “Damn it, Zorian, why didn’t you hold on?!”\r\n\r\n“You’d be dead, then!” Zorian protested. He wasn’t going to let a person who helped him so much tonight die from a stray spell if he could help it. Besides, whoever had cast it would surely fall to Zach’s magical might, just like the rest of the creatures and enemy mages they had encountered so far. Just how bad could this enemy caster be, really?\r\n\r\nA sudden gust of air blew the dust away and a gaunt humanoid figure stepped into view. Zorian actually gasped in surprise as he took in the appearance of the thing in front of them. It was a skeleton wreathed in sickly green light. Its bones were black with a strange metallic sheen, as if they were not bones at all, but rather a facsimile of a skeleton made out of some kind of black metal. Encased in gold-decorated armor, with a scepter held tightly in one of its skeletal hands and a crown full of purple gemstones, the creature looked like some long-dead king risen from the dead.\r\n\r\nIt was a lich. It was a thrice-damned lich! Oh, they were so going to die…\r\n\r\nThe lich swept its empty eye sockets over them. As Zorian’s eyes met the black pits that once held the lich’s eyes, an uncomfortable feeling washed over him, like the lich was peering into his very soul. After less than a second, the lich lazily shifted its attention to Zach, apparently dismissing Zorian as something of no consequence.\r\n\r\n“So…” the lich spoke, its voice resonant with power, “You’re the one that has been killing my minions.”\r\n\r\n“Zorian, run away while I deal with this guy,” Zach said, clutching the staff in his hand.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a response, Zach launched a barrage of magic missiles towards the lich, who retaliated with a trio of purple beams as it erected an aegis around itself with a single wave of its bony hand. Two of them were aimed at Zach, but sadly enough the lich saw fit to aim one towards Zorian’s retreating form. While it failed to hit Zorian directly, the beam’s impact with the nearby ground created a sizeable explosion that drove stone shrapnel into his legs. The pain was immense, and Zorian collapsed on the ground in an instant, unable to take a single step further.\r\n\r\nOver the next five minutes, Zorian painfully dragged himself behind a nearby cart, hoping that it would shield him from at least some of the destructive power that was being thrown around in the battle. Zach was keeping the lich occupied enough that it didn’t send any more spells after Zorian, which was fortunate because Zorian was no longer in any state to evade them. He watched with growing unease as Zach and the lich exchanged various destructive spells that Zorian couldn’t even identify, realizing with rising dread that his prediction of their grisly death was well founded – no matter how good Zach was, he was not even in the same league as the lich. The thing was toying with the other boy, and was bound to tire of the game sooner or-\r\n\r\nHe winced as a spear-like red bolt punched straight through Zach’s aegis and impaled the boy through his flank. He suspected the hit was in a non-vital spot only because the lich wished to gloat a little more, and his suspicious were all but confirmed when the creature didn’t finish Zach off with anything destructive, opting instead to hurl Zach into the air with a single casual gesture. Zach collided with the wall near where Zorian was taking cover, and groaned in pain.\r\n\r\nApparently not in any sort of hurry, the lich approached slowly. It seemed unconcerned that Zach was rising shakily to his feet, a spell rod clenched tightly in his left hand. Zorian could see that his right hand was pressed tightly against the bleeding wound on his flank.\r\n\r\n“You put up quite a fight, child,” the lich said. “Impressive for someone who is supposed to be a mere academy student.”\r\n\r\n“Not… impressive enough,” Zach gasped out, the spell rod dropping from his hand as he clutched the wound on his flank with both hands, apparently in great pain. “I guess… I’ll have to… try harder… next time.”\r\n\r\nThe lich chuckled. It was strange sound, hardly fitting the creature. “Next time? Silly child, there will be no next time. There is no way I’m letting you live, surely you know that?”\r\n\r\n“Bah,” Zach spat, straightening himself with a grimace. “Enough talking, just get it over with.”\r\n\r\n“You seem surprisingly unconcerned considering you’re about to die,” the lich remarked conversationally.\r\n\r\n“Ah, whatever,“ said Zack, rolling his eyes. “It’s not like I’ll be dead for good.”\r\n\r\nZorian looked at Zach incredulously, not really understanding what Zach was getting at. The lich seemed to understand, though.\r\n\r\n“Aaah, I see,” the lich said. “You must be new to soul magic if you think this makes you invulnerable. I could just trap your soul in a soul jar, but I have a much better idea.”\r\n\r\nThe lich casually gestured towards Zorian, and he suddenly felt his entire body freeze up as if it was encased in some alien force. Another wave and Zorian was hurled with great speed towards the shocked Zach, where he painfully slammed into the other boy. They both ended up on the ground in a tangle of limbs, and Zorian was relieved that at least the unknown force paralyzing him was gone.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter if your soul can be reincarnated elsewhere if someone mutilates it beyond recognition before it gets there,” the lich said. “After all, the soul may be immortal, but no one said it cannot be altered or added to.”\r\n\r\nDimly, Zorian could hear the lich chanting in some strange language that definitely wasn’t standard Ikosian used in traditional invocations, but any curiosity about this was washed away by a wave of pain and unidentifiable wrongness that suddenly slammed into him. He opened his mouth to scream but then his world suddenly erupted into bright light before suddenly going completely black.');

('Start Over\r\n', 'Mother of Learning', 5, 'Zorian’s eyes abruptly shot open as sharp pain erupted from his stomach. His whole body convulsed, buckling against the object that fell on him, and suddenly he was wide awake, not a trace of drowsiness in his mind.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, brother!” an annoyingly cheerful voice sounded right on top of him. “Morning, morning, MORNING!!!”\r\n\r\nZorian stared at Kirielle in shock, trying to understand what happened. The last thing he remembered was the lich casting that spell at him and Zach, and then blackness. His eyes darted left and right, taking in his surroundings and confirming his suspicions – he was in his room, back in Cirin. That didn’t make any sense, though. He was pleased that he survived the whole experience, but at the very least he expected to wake up in the hospital or something. And Kirielle shouldn’t be this casual with him after he went through so harrowing an experience – not even she was this inconsiderate. Besides, this entire scene was… eerily familiar.\r\n\r\n“Kiri?”\r\n\r\n“Um, yes?”\r\n\r\n“What day is it?” Zorian asked, already dreading the answer.\r\n\r\n“Thursday.”\r\n\r\nHe scowled. “I meant date, Kiri.”\r\n\r\n“First of Chariot. You’re going to the academy today. Don’t tell me you forgot,” Kirielle prodded. Literally – she accompanied her words with a well-placed jab at his flank, sticking her bony little index finger in between his ribs. Zorian slapped her hand away, hissing in pain.\r\n\r\n“I did not forget!” Zorian snapped. “I just…”\r\n\r\nHe stopped there. What was he supposed to tell her? Frankly, he had no idea what was going on himself!\r\n\r\n“You know what?” he said after a moment of silence. “Never mind that, I think it’s high time you got off of me.”\r\n\r\nBefore Kirielle could answer, Zorian unceremoniously flipped her over the edge of the bed before jumping up himself.\r\n\r\nHe snatched his glasses from the set of drawers next to his bed and his eyes swept through his room with more attention to detail this time, seeking anything out of place, anything that might unmask this as a giant (if rather tasteless) prank. While his memory wasn’t flawless, he had a habit of arranging his belongings in very specific ways to detect nosy family members rummaging through his belongings. He found nothing massively out of place, so unless his mysterious re-enactor knew his system inside and out (unlikely) or Kiri finally decided she’d respect the sanctity of his room while he was away (hell would sooner freeze over), this really was his room like he left it when he went to Cyoria.\r\n\r\nWas it all a dream, then? It seemed altogether too real for a dream. His dreams had always been vague, nonsensical, and prone to evaporate out of his memory soon after he woke up. These felt exactly like his normal memories – no talking birds, floating pyramids, three-eyed wolves and other surreal scenes his dreams usually contained. And there was so much of it, too – surely a whole month worth of experiences is too much for a mere dream?\r\n\r\n“Mom wants to talk to you,” Kirielle told him from the floor, apparently not in any great hurry to get up. “But hey, can you show me some magic before you get down? Please? Pretty please?”\r\n\r\nZorian frowned. Magic, huh? Come to think of it, he learned quite a bit of magic. Surely if this was all a particularly elaborate dream all the magic he learned there would be completely bogus, right?\r\n\r\nHe made a couple of sweeping gestures and words before cupping his hands in front of him. A floating orb of light promptly materialized above his palms.\r\n\r\nHuh. Not just an elaborate dream, then.\r\n\r\n“That’s amazing!” Kirielle gushed, poking the orb with her finger only to have it pass straight through it. Not surprising, really, since it was just light. She withdrew her finger and curiously stared at it, as if expecting to find it changed somehow. Zorian mentally directed the orb to fly around the room and circle Kirielle a few times. Yep, he definitely knew the spell – he retained not just the memory of the casting procedure, but also the fine control he developed with repeated practice with it. You don’t get things like that from a mere vision, even a prophetic one.\r\n\r\n“More! More!” demanded Kirielle.\r\n\r\n“Oh come on, Kiri,” sighed Zorian. He really wasn’t in the mood for her antics at the moment. “I indulged you, didn’t I? Go find something else to amuse yourself now.”\r\n\r\nShe pouted at him, but he was thoroughly immune to such things by now. Then she frowned for a moment and suddenly straightened as if remembering something.\r\n\r\nWait…\r\n\r\n“No!” Zorian shouted, but he was already too late. Kiri already ran into the bathroom and slammed the door behind her. “Damn it, Kiri, why now? Why not before I woke up?”\r\n\r\n“Sucks to be you,” she answered.\r\n\r\nZorian leaned forward until his forehead collided with the door. “I had forewarning and I still fell for it.”\r\n\r\nHe frowned. Forewarning, indeed. Whatever his ‘future memories’ were, they seemed to be fairly reliable. Was Cyoria really going to get invaded during the summer festival, then? What should he do about that? What could he do about that? He shook his head and marched back to his room. He would not even contemplate that sort of question until he found out more about what had happened to him. He locked the door so he would have some privacy and sat on his bed. He needed to think.\r\n\r\nOkay. So he lived through a whole month of school before… something happened… and then he woke up in his room back in Cirin, as if the entire month never happened. Even with magic factored in, that was preposterous. Time travel was impossible. He didn’t have any books in his room that discussed the topic at any appreciable length, but all of the passages that dealt with time travel agreed that it couldn’t be done. Even dimensional magic could only warp time, speeding it up or slowing it. It was one of the few things mages agreed was beyond the ability of magic to accomplish.\r\n\r\nSo how, then, was he living through it?\r\n\r\nHe was just in the process of consulting the books in his room for any type of magic that could ‘fake’ time travel in some way when a knock on his door interrupted his thoughts, and he suddenly realized he was still in his pajamas and that mother wanted to talk to him quite a while ago. He quickly changed and opened the door, only to find himself under the scrutiny of two women, only one of which was his mother.\r\n\r\nHe almost greeted Ilsa by name, but he caught himself in time.\r\n\r\n“A teacher from the academy has come to talk to you,” his mother said, her disapproving stare telling him she was going to give him an earful once Ilsa left.\r\n\r\n“Greetings,” Ilsa said. “I am Ilsa Zileti, from Cyoria’s Royal Academy of Magical Arts. I was hoping to speak to you about some matters before you leave. It won’t take long.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Zorian. “Um, where do you…”\r\n\r\n“Your room shall suffice,” Ilsa said.\r\n\r\n“I’ll bring you something to drink,” his mother said, excusing herself.\r\n\r\nZorian watched Ilsa as she unpacked various papers and placed them on his desk (what was she doing with those, anyway?), trying to decide how to proceed with this. If his future memories were valid, she should be handing him the scroll right about…\r\n\r\nYeah, there it is. Knowing what’s going to happen in advance is weird.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of appearances Zorian gave the scroll a cursory examination before channeling mana into it. It was exactly how he remembered it – the calligraphy, the flowery official-sounding phrases, the elaborate crest at the bottom of the document – and Zorian felt a wave of dread wash over him. What the hell had he gotten himself involved in? He had no idea what was happening to him, but it was big. Very big.\r\n\r\nHe had the urge to tell Ilsa about his predicament and seek her advice, but he restrained himself. It sounded like the most sensible thing to do – surely a fully trained mage like her was far more qualified for tackling this than he was – but what could he possibly tell her? That he was remembering things that hadn\'t happened yet? Yeah, that would go over well. Besides, considering the nature of his future memories, he could easily see himself arrested if a conspiracy to invade Cyoria was really discovered thanks to his warnings. After all, it’s far more likely his shocking knowledge comes from being a defector of the conspiracy than him being some kind of weird time traveler. An image of a couple of government agents torturing him for information briefly flittered through his mind and he shuddered.\r\n\r\nNo, best to keep all this to himself for now.\r\n\r\nSo for the next 10 minutes, Zorian basically reenacted his memories of his initial interaction with Ilsa, not seeing the point in choosing differently this time – all of his choices were made for reasons that were currently every bit as valid as they were in his future memories. He didn’t argue with Ilsa about Xvim this time around, though, since he already knew arguing over that topic was pointless, and he didn’t request a bathroom break, since he already knew what electives he wished to take. Ilsa seemed completely indifferent to his strange decisiveness, apparently just as eager as he was to get this whole thing out of the way. Then again, why would she be surprised at his decisiveness? She had no future memories to compare this entire encounter to, unlike him. Hell, she didn’t even know him up until now.\r\n\r\nZorian sighed and shook his head. They really did feel just like normal memories, and it was hard to ignore them. This is going to be one long month.\r\n\r\n“Are you alright, Mr. Kazinski?”\r\n\r\nZorian glanced at Ilsa curiously, trying to divine why she asked him that. She glanced towards his hands – only for a moment, but Zorian caught it. His hands were shaking. He balled them into fists and took a deep breath.\r\n\r\n“I’m fine,” he said. A second or so of uncomfortable silence ensued, Ilsa apparently unwilling to continue with her closing speech while she continued to study him. “Can I ask you a question?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” Ilsa said. “That’s why I’m here.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think about time travel?”\r\n\r\nShe was clearly taken aback by the question – it was probably the last thing she expected him to ask, or at least close to the bottom of the list. She composed herself very quickly though.\r\n\r\n“Time travel is impossible,” Ilsa said firmly. “Time can only be dilated or compressed. Never skipped or reversed.\'\'\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Zorian, honestly curious. He had never actually seen an explanation for the impossibility of time travel, though that might be because he wasn’t terribly interested in the topic up until now.\r\n\r\nIlsa sighed. “I admit I’m not particularly knowledgeable about the details, but our best theories indicate that going against temporal currents is utterly impossible. As in ‘draw a square circle’ impossible, not ‘leap over the ocean’ impossible. The river of time flows only in one direction. Beyond that, innumerable attempts have been made in recorded past, all ending in failure.” She gave him a sharp look. “I sincerely hope you won’t waste your talents on such a fool’s quest.”\r\n\r\n“I was just curious,” Zorian said defensively. “I was just reading a chapter discussing limitations of magic and wondered why the author was so certain time travel is impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Well now you know,” Ilsa said, getting up. “Now if that’s all, I really should be going. I’ll be happy to answer any further questions on Monday after class. Have a nice day.”\r\n\r\nZorian watched her leave and shut the door behind her before collapsing back on his bed. Definitely a long month.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nFor once the train ride didn’t put Zorian to sleep. He had subtly prodded mother with some sensitive topics when she tried to scold him and he was pretty sure this wasn’t some kind of elaborate illusion, unless the illusionist was aware of some very closely kept family secrets. And he seemed far too lucid for this to be some kind of induced hallucination. As far as he could tell at the moment, he really did travel back in time. He had spent most of the train ride writing down everything of importance he could think of in one of his notebooks. He didn’t really think the memories were going to fade any time soon, but it helped him organize his thoughts and notice details he might have otherwise missed. He noted that he forgot to retrieve his books from under Kiri\'s bed in all the confusion, but decided it didn’t matter. If the classes were anything like they were the last time around, he wouldn’t need them for the duration of the first month.\r\n\r\nIt was that last spell the lich performed on him and Zach, Zorian was sure of it. The trouble was, Zorian had no idea what the spell was. Even the words were unfamiliar. Standard incantations used Ikosian words as their base, and Zorian knew enough of Ikosian to get a general feel of a spell just by listening to what the caster’s chanting, but the lich used a different language for his incantation. Fortunately, Zorian had a really good memory and remembered most of the chant, so he wrote it down in his trusty notebook in phonetic form. He was pretty sure he wouldn’t find the spell itself anywhere within his clearance level, as the spell was probably highly restricted and kept out of reach of first circle mages like him, but he would see about identifying the language and finding a proper dictionary in the academy library.\r\n\r\nThe other clue to this whole thing was Zach himself. The boy was capable of fighting a lich – a freaking lich! – for several minutes before succumbing to it. Even though the lich had been toying with him, it was still pretty impressive. Zorian would put Zach on par with a 3rd circle mage, and probably more. What the hell was that guy doing with academy students then? Something was definitely strange about Zach, though Zorian had no intention of confronting the guy directly until he found out more about what’s going on. For all he knew, it could be one of those ‘you know about us, so now we have to kill you’ sort of things. He would have to tread carefully around the Noveda heir.\r\n\r\nZorian slammed the notebook shut and ran his hand through his hair. No matter how he looked at it, this whole situation seemed utterly crazy. Did he really have memories from the future or was he simply going insane? Both possibilities were terrifying. He was in no way qualified to tackle something like this on his own, but he didn’t know how to get other people to help him without being carted off either to a madhouse or an interrogation chamber.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to think about it later. As in, tomorrow later. This whole thing was simply too weird, and he needed to sleep on it before he decides anything.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, is this seat free?”\r\n\r\nZorian glanced at the speaker, recognizing her after a second of recollection. The nameless green turtleneck girl that joined him in his compartment when they took a stop at Korsa. Of course, the last time she didn’t bother to ask for permission before taking a seat. What changed? Ah, it didn’t matter – what did matter is that last time she was soon followed by four other girls. Very loud, very obnoxious girls. No way he’d be spending the rest of the train ride listening to their banter… again.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” he nodded. “In fact, I was just leaving. We’re stopping at Korsa, right? Good day, miss.”\r\n\r\nAnd then he quickly grabbed his luggage and went to search for another compartment, abandoning the girl to her fate.\r\n\r\nMaybe these future memories are good for something, after all.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nBam!\r\n\r\n“Roach!”\r\n\r\nBam! Bam! Bam!\r\n\r\n“Roach, open the thrice damned door! I know you’re in here!”\r\n\r\nZorian rolled over in his bed and groaned. What the hell was Taiven doing here this early? No wait… He snatched the clock from his dresser and brought it in front of his face… she wasn’t early, he just slept past noon. Huh. He distinctly remembered going straight to the academy from the train station and falling asleep minutes after reaching his room, yet he still overslept like this. Apparently dying and then awakening in the past is tiresome business.\r\n\r\nBam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!\r\n\r\n“I’m coming, I’m coming!” shouted Zorian. “Stop banging on my door, already!”\r\n\r\nNaturally, she just kept banging on it with more enthusiasm. Zorian rushed to make himself presentable and stomped towards the door. Wrenching the door open, he gave Taiven a withering look…\r\n\r\n…which she promptly ignored.\r\n\r\n“Finally!” she said. “What the hell took you so long!?”\r\n\r\n“I was sleeping,” Zorian ground out.\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” ground out.\r\n\r\n“But-“\r\n\r\n“I was tired,” Zorian snapped. “Very tired. And what the hell are you waiting for? Get inside.”\r\n\r\nShe rushed inside and Zorian took a moment to collect himself before he confronted her. In his future memories, she never visited him once after he refused to go along with her mission to the sewers, which spoke volumes about her true feelings about this ‘friendship’ of theirs. Then again, he hardly even thought about her himself until now, so he probably shouldn’t judge. In any case, he was even less inclined to join her on this mission now than he was in his future memories – he actually had more pressing matters to attend to this time, in addition to general apprehensiveness that was still as valid now as it was then. Accordingly, he felt a lot less reluctance in simply blowing her off, and it only took him an hour to convince her to leave him alone.\r\n\r\nThat done, he immediately set out for the library, making a short detour to a nearby bakery for a quick bite to tide him over. Once in the library he started searching for books on the topic of time travel and trying to identify the language the lich used in his spell.\r\n\r\nTo call it disappointing would be calling it mildly. For one thing, there were no books on time travel. The topic was not considered a serious field of study, what with it being impossible and all. What little was written about it was scattered across innumerable volumes, hidden in unmarked sections and paragraphs of otherwise unrelated books. Piecing together these scattered mentions was an absolute chore, and not all that rewarding either – none of it was useful in solving the mystery of his future memories. Finding the language the lich used in his spell was even more frustrating, since he failed to even identify the language, much less translate the chant.\r\n\r\nHe spent the entire weekend fruitlessly sifting through library texts, finally abandoning that avenue of research when it became obvious it wasn’t producing any results. Plus the library workers were starting to give him weird looks at his choice of literature and he didn’t want to create any unfortunate rumors. Hopefully he would be able to trick Zach into revealing what the hell was going on when school started.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\n“You’re late.”\r\n\r\nZorian stared at Akoja’s stern face in quiet contemplation. He was glad he wouldn’t have to deal with any drama because of his disastrous evening with her – almost as glad as he was about the fact that he wasn’t dead – but he couldn’t help but wonder what her outburst had been about. She didn’t really look like she had a crush on him, so why did his comment hit her so heavily?\r\n\r\n“What?” she asked, and Zorian realized he had been staring at her a little too long. Oops.\r\n\r\n“Ako, why are you telling me this when more than half the class isn’t even here yet?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Because there is at least a chance you will listen, unlike them,” Akoja admitted. “Also, someone like you should be an example to other students, not descend to their level.”\r\n\r\n“Someone like me?” inquired Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Just get inside,” she snapped irritably.\r\n\r\nHe sighed and went inside. It was probably for the best to leave things be – he had other problems to deal with, and she was far too rule-bound for his tastes anyway.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t know what he was expecting to happen when he walked into the class. Everyone to stop what they were doing and stare at him, maybe? At least then he would have a reason for feeling so unnerved at attending his first class of the year for the second time. But of course they did no such thing. It wasn’t a second time for them, and there was nothing visibly irregular about him for them to take notice. He quashed his unease and sat down in the back of the class, discreetly scanning new arrivals for signs of Zach. He was sure the other boy was connected to this somehow, and the mysterious boy appeared to be Zorian’s best chance at understanding what was happening to him.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief commotion when Briam’s fire drake familiar hissed up a storm and started chasing Briam’s terrified neighbor across the classroom before Briam calmed it down. Apparently the magical reptile liked the unfortunate boy even less than it did Zorian. In any case, Ilsa came in soon after and started the class.\r\n\r\nZach never showed up.\r\n\r\nZorian spent the entire class in a daze, shocked at this turn of events. Where the hell was Zach? Everything happened almost exactly as it did in his future memories so far, with Zach’s absence being the first major deviation. This firmly cemented Zach as somehow connected to this madness, but it also put the boy out of Zorian’s reach for the moment.\r\n\r\nThe lecture was even more annoying now than it was the first time he listened to it, since from his perspective he went through these review sessions less than a month ago. Apparently Ilsa worked off some kind of a script, because the lecture was virtually identical to the one from his memory, the only difference being that Zach wasn’t there to compete with Akoja for answering Ilsa’s questions to the class.\r\n\r\nFunny how things seem clearer in retrospect. Zach was acting strange right from the start, in that very first lecture, but Zorian thought nothing of it. Sure, Zach volunteering to answer the teacher’s questions was out of character for the boy, but not completely implausible. It was just a review session anyway, and they had to know these things to pass the certification. It took two weeks before people really began to take notice the extent of Zach’s sudden improvement.\r\n\r\nSo many questions, so few answers. He could only hope that Zach would show up soon.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nZach didn’t come to class that day, or the next, or the day after that. By Friday, Zorian was pretty sure the other boy wouldn’t be showing up at all. According to Benisek, Zach simply disappeared from his family mansion on the very same day that Zorian took the train to Cyoria, and nobody had seen a hint of him ever since. Zorian didn’t think he could cook up anything the investigators hired by the boy’s guardian hadn’t thought of doing, and he didn’t want to attract attention to himself by asking around, so he reluctantly put the mystery of Zach aside for the moment.\r\n\r\nHis schoolwork was going well, at least. Thanks to his foreknowledge, he aced Nora Boole’s surprise tests and didn’t really have to study for any subject – a small refresher was sufficient to coast him through pretty much anything. Once his warding class really gets going that’s probably going to change, but for now he had all the free time he wanted to deliberate on what he should do about the rapidly approaching summer festival and the accompanying assault.\r\n\r\nSadly, with Zach absent, Zorian had hit dead ends in all the clues he had, and was now at loss how to proceed.\r\n\r\n“Come in.”\r\n\r\nZorian opened the door to Xvim’s office and defiantly met the man’s gaze. He was pretty confident in the accuracy of his ‘future’ memories by now, Zach’s mysterious absence aside, so he knew this was going to be another exercise in frustration. He was tempted to boycott the meetings, but he suspected it was his stoic perseverance in the face of the man’s antagonism that eventually convinced Ilsa to take him under her wing. And besides, he felt that he would be doing Xvim a favor if he quit – Zorian had a distinct feeling that the man was trying to get him to quit the last time around – and he was far too spiteful to do that. He sat down without prompting, a little disappointed that the man hadn’t remarked upon his intentionally rude gesture.\r\n\r\n“Zorian Kazinski?” Xvim asked. Zorian nodded and expertly snatched the pen that the man had throw at him out of the air, having expected it this time.\r\n\r\n“Show me your basic three,” the man ordered, not in the least bit surprised at the feat of coordination.\r\n\r\nInstantly, without even an extra deep breath, Zorian opened his palm, the pen practically jumping out of his palm and into the air.\r\n\r\n“Make it spin,” Xvim said.\r\n\r\nZorian’s eyes widened. What happened to ‘start over’? His current attempt wasn’t any worse than what he displayed during their last session before that fateful dance, and Xvim’s only response that night had been ‘start over’, just like any other time. What changed now?\r\n\r\n“Are you having problems with hearing?” Xvim asked. “Make it spin!”\r\n\r\nZorian blinked, finally realizing he should be focusing on the current session instead of his memories. “What? What do you mean ‘make it spin’? That’s not part of the basic three…”\r\n\r\nXvim sighed dramatically and slowly took another pen and levitated it over his own palm. Instead of just hanging in the air like Zorian’s, however, Xvim’s pen was spinning like a fan.\r\n\r\n“I… have no idea how to do that,” Zorian admitted. “We weren’t taught how to do that in classes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is criminal how badly the classes are failing our students,” Xvim said. “Such a simple variation of a levitation exercise should not be beyond the grasp of a certified mage. No matter, we shall correct this deficiency before we move on to other matters.”\r\n\r\nZorian sighed. Great. No wonder no one ever mastered the basic three to Xvim’s liking if the man keeps redefining what ‘mastered’ means. There were probably hundreds of ‘small variations’ of each of the basic three, enough to spend decades learning them all, so little wonder no one could exhaust them all in two measly years. Especially considering Xvim’s standards for labeling the skill ‘mastered’.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” Xvim urged. “Start.”\r\n\r\nZorian focused intensely on the pen hanging above his palm, trying to figure out how to do that. It should be relatively simple. He just had to affix a stabilization point in the middle of the pen and put pressure on the ends, right? At least, that’s the first thing that popped into his head. He had just managed to get the pen to move a bit when he felt a familiar object impact onto his forehead.\r\n\r\nZorian glared at Xvim, cursing himself for forgetting about the man’s damnable marbles. Xvim glanced at the pen that was still hovering over Zorian’s palm.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t lose focus,” Xvim remarked. “Good.”\r\n\r\n“You threw a marble at me,” Zorian accused.\r\n\r\n“I was hurrying you up,” Xvim said, unrepentant. “You’re too slow. You must be faster. Faster, faster, faster! Start over.”\r\n\r\nZorian sighed and returned to his task. Yup, definitely an exercise in frustration.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nBetween his unfamiliarity with the exercise and Xvim’s constant interruptions, Zorian only managed to get the pen to wobble by the end of the session, which was… a little humiliating, actually. His above average shaping skills were one of the few things that set him aside from his fellow mages, and he felt he should have done much better, despite Xvim’s repeated sabotage attempts. Fortunately, a book describing the exercise in detail was easy to find in the academy library, so he would hopefully master it by next week. Well, not master it – not in the sense that Xvim wanted him to – but he at least wanted to know what he was doing before he tackled his next session with Xvim.\r\n\r\nOf course, normally he wouldn’t be willing to pour that much effort into a lousy shaping exercise, but he needed a distraction. At the beginning, the entire time travel situation was so patently ridiculous that he found it easy to remain calm and collected. Some part of him kept expecting that the whole thing was a double dream or something, and that he would wake up one day and not remember a thing. That part was becoming panicked and agitated now that it became obvious that the situation he faced was real. What the hell was he supposed to do? Zach’s mysterious absence weighted heavily upon him, inflaming his paranoia and making him reluctant to tell anyone about the invasion. Zorian was not a fundamentally selfless person and didn’t want to save people only to screw himself over in the end. Whatever his future memories really were, they were in essence his second chance at life – he was pretty sure he died at the end of his future memories – and he had no intention to squander it. He did consider it his ethical duty to warn people of the danger threatening the city, but there had to be a way to do it without destroying his life or reputation.\r\n\r\nThe simplest idea would be to warn as many people as possible (thus ensuring that at least some of them take the warnings seriously) and do so face-to-face, since written communications can be ignored in a way that is not really possible in personal interactions. Unfortunately, that would almost certainly paint him as a madman until he’s eventually vindicated by the actual assault. If there is an assault, that is – what if the conspirators decide to lay low upon having their plans unmasked and the invasion doesn’t happen? What if nobody takes him seriously until it’s too late and then decide to turn him into a scapegoat in order to shift responsibility away from themselves? What if one of the people he tries to warn is part of the conspiracy and has him killed before he can tell anyone else? What if, what if… way too many what ifs. And he had a sneaking suspicion that one of those what ifs was responsible for Zach’s disappearance.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these musings, the idea of staying anonymous appealed to him more and more with each passing day. The problem was that sending a message to a bunch of people without having it traced back to you was not at all simple when magic got involved. Divinations weren’t all-powerful, but Zorian had only academic understanding of their limitations, and his precautions probably wouldn’t hold against a motivated search by a skilled diviner.\r\n\r\nZorian sighed and started outlining a tentative plan into his notebook, completely ignoring their history teacher’s enthusiastic lecture. He had to figure out who to contact, what to put into the letters, and how to ensure they couldn’t be traced back to him. He somehow doubted the government would allow authors to publish instructions on how to evade detection from law enforcement, but he would still check the library to see what they have on the topic. He was so caught up in his self-appointed task he barely noticed when the class ended, furiously scribbling away while everyone else packed and filed out of the classroom. He definitely didn’t notice Benisek peering over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?”\r\n\r\nZorian slammed his notebook shut in a reflexive maneuver as soon as Benisek started talking and gave the other boy a nasty glare.\r\n\r\n“It’s impolite to look over other people’s shoulders,” Zorian remarked.\r\n\r\n“Jumpy, aren’t we?” smiled Benisek, loudly dragging a chair from the nearby table so he could sit on the other side of Zorian’s table. “Relax, I didn’t see anything.”\r\n\r\n“Not for the lack of trying,” remarked Zorian. Benisek only grinned wider. “What do you want, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“Just wanted to talk for a bit,” Benisek shrugged. “You’re been really withdrawn this year. You’ve got this frustrated look on your face all the time, and you’re always busy even though it’s the start of the school year. Wanted to know what was bothering you, you know?”\r\n\r\nZorian sighed. “This isn’t something you can help me with, Ben…”\r\n\r\nBenisek made a strangled noise, apparently outraged by his remark. “What do you mean I can’t help you!? I’ll have you know I’m an expert on girl trouble.”\r\n\r\nNow it was Zorian’s turn to make a strangled noise. “Girl trouble!?”\r\n\r\n“Oh come on,” Benisek laughed. “Constantly distracted? Spacing out in the middle of the class? Making plans for sending anonymous letters? It’s obvious, man! Who’s the lucky girl?”\r\n\r\n“There is no ‘lucky girl’,” Zorian growled. “And I thought you didn’t see anything?”\r\n\r\n“Listen, I don’t think sending anonymous letters is a good idea,” Benisek said, completely ignoring his remarks. “That’s so… first year, you know? You should just walk up to her and tell her how you feel.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t have time for this,” Zorian sighed, getting up from his seat.\r\n\r\n“Hey, come on…” protested Benisek, trailing after him. “Man, you’re one touchy guy, did anybody tell you that? I was just…”\r\n\r\nZorian ignored him. He really didn’t need this right now.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, Zorian should have known that simply ignoring Benisek wasn’t such a good idea. It only took two days for most of the class to ‘know’ that Zorian has a crush on someone, and their loud speculation was annoying as hell. Not to mention distracting. Still, his displeasure at the rumors evaporated when Neolu approached him one day and gave him a short list of ‘books he might find useful’. He had half a mind to set the list on fire, especially since the list was decorated with dozens of little hearts, but in the end his natural curiosity won over and he went to the library to check them out. He figured that at the very least he’d get a good laugh out of them.\r\n\r\nHe got more than a good laugh, though – instead of silly love advice like he expected, the books Neolu recommended were all about making sure your letters, gifts, and such couldn’t be traced back to you with divinations and other magic. Apparently if you call such advice Forbidden Love: Mysteries of Scarlet Letters Revealed and phrase it as relationship advice you can get straight past the usual censorship such topics would normally be subjected to.\r\n\r\nOf course, he had no idea how reliable the advice in those books really was, and the librarian looked at him funny when he checked out books like that, but he was still pleased to have found them. If this whole thing worked out in the end he’d have to do something nice for Neolu.\r\n\r\nSo as the summer festival approached, Zorian prepared and plotted. He bought a whole stack of generic paper sheets, pens, and envelopes in one of the stores that looked too poor and disorganized to track their customers’ purchases. He worded the letters carefully to avoid revealing any personal details. He made sure not to touch the paper with his bare hands at any point, and that none of his sweat, hair, or blood ended up in the envelope. He deliberately wrote in a blocky, formal script that looked nothing like his normal handwriting. He destroyed the pens, the excess paper, and envelopes he didn’t use in the end.\r\n\r\nAnd then, a week before the festival, he put the letters in different public postal boxes all over Cyoria and waited.\r\n\r\nIt was… nerve-wracking, to say the least. Nothing happened, though – no one came to confront him about the letters, which was good, but also nothing out of the ordinary seemed to be happening. Did no one believe him? Did he mess up somehow and the letters ended up not reaching their intended recipients? Are they being so subtle in their reaction that no disturbance is being made? The wait was killing him.\r\n\r\nFinally, he had enough. On the evening before the dance he decided he’d done everything he could and took the first train out of the city. His letters may or may not have worked, but this way he’ll be alright regardless. If anyone asked (though he doubted they would), he’ll use his trusty ‘alchemical accident’ excuse. He messed up a potion and breathed in some hallucinogenic fumes, only coming to his senses when he was already outside of Cyoria. Yes, that’s exactly what happened.\r\n\r\nAs the train sped away from Cyoria in the dead of a night, Zorian suppressed his unease and feelings of guilt for doing so little to warn anyone of the approaching attack. What else could he have done? Nothing, that’s what. Nothing at all.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he fell into uneasy sleep, the rhythmic thumping of the train his lullaby, visions of falling stars and skeletons wreathed in green light haunting his dreams.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nZorian’s eyes abruptly shot open as sharp pain erupted from his stomach. His whole body convulsed, buckling against the object that fell on him, and suddenly he was wide awake, not a trace of drowsiness in his mind.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, brother!” an annoyingly cheerful voice sounded right on top of him. “Morning, morning, MORNING!!!”\r\n\r\nZorian gaped at his little sister incredulously, his mouth opening and closing periodically. What, again?\r\n\r\n“Oh you’ve got to be kidding me!” Zorian growled, and Kirielle quickly got off of him and scooted away fearfully. Apparently she thought his ire was directed at her. “Not you, Kiri, I… I just had a nightmare, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t believe it, it happened again!? What the hell? He was glad it happened last time, since it meant he wasn’t… you know, dead. But now? Now it was just freaky. Why was this happening to him?\r\n\r\nOh, and while he was lamenting his fate internally, Kirielle barricaded herself in the bathroom again. God damn it all!');

('System Day I', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 2, '\r\n\r\nA raw, primal scream was being wrenched from my throat, my mind and body wracked by pain. The pain of loss, the pain of death, the pain of ending.\r\n\r\nA crisp snap broke through my screaming, the pair of fingers that did the deed appearing in my vision. An old pair of fingers started the snap; a young pair of fingers ended the snap. I felt a strange force invade my mind, grab something, twist, and rip. I cried out in pain, a sense of loss washing over me. My mouth closed, every breath sending fresh flames of torment radiating from my lungs.\r\n\r\nA tall, thin man was in front of me, speaking. “I do really hate the screaming, but I suppose that’s what happens when you mortals die.”\r\n\r\nWait what!? Die!? I was in class just a second ago! What did he mean die!? I was too young to die! I could feel the panic quickly mounting again, my breath becoming shorter and faster as I started to hyperventilate.\r\n\r\n“Who are you? Where is this? What do you mean die!?”\r\n\r\nAs I shot my questions off rapid-fire, I looked around.\r\n\r\nI was disoriented. Dazed. Pain and anguish were clawing at my heart, my mind, my very soul, but slowly, oh so slowly, it was starting to fade.\r\n\r\nUntil I noticed where I was. And where I wasn’t.\r\n\r\nThen it all came rushing back, and while I’d been silenced nothing stopped me from hyperventilating there’snoairhereohmygod!\r\n\r\nA pair of fingers snapped again, and the man spoke once more, derision dripping from the single word he uttered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Honestly.”\r\n\r\nMy mind cleared.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI wasn’t sure where I was anymore – I seemed to be floating in space, surrounded by twinkling stars and galaxies, comets and planets. It wasn’t home, it wasn’t school, it wasn’t even earth. There was nobody present except the tall thin man, floating impossibly in front of me, looking both ancient and young, happy and sad, male and female, tall and short, fat and skinny, red and blue – wait what?\r\n\r\nI pinched myself, putting all my might into it. Only thing to do really. This dream was way too trippy for me.\r\n\r\nI jumped as an electric shock went through me. I was still here, wherever here was. That didn’t bode well.\r\n\r\nI might be in a minor spot of serious trouble.\r\n\r\nA deep, long-suffering sigh escaped him? Her?\r\n\r\n“You died. I took the memory of you dying to calm you down. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to have worked nearly as well as it should’ve.”, and I heard, barely under her breath “Mortals.”\r\n\r\nI felt an enforced calmness come over me, my panic not going away, just… not mattering anymore. Given where I was, strange floating among the stars with what can only be described as a super powerful shape-shifter, I could believe I had died. This wasn’t Kansas anymore.\r\n\r\n“Now then, we can have a discussion. You have died. Your soul has failed to properly re-enter the cycle of reincarnation, and I found you just floating in the void.”\r\n\r\nTheir face twisted in an unhappy grimace, and I felt an instinctive fear run through my…\r\n\r\nDid I even have a body anymore? Was I just a soul now?\r\n\r\nI didn\'t know what to make of being told I’d died, that my life was over. I did know that I hadn’t been old, or even middle-aged when I died. Had I even made it to adulthood!? I tried to make a disgruntled noise – the enforced calm was preventing any sort of outrage, only to discover that I couldn’t make a sound.\r\n\r\nThat bastard.\r\n\r\nWe couldn’t have a ‘discussion’ if I couldn’t say a single word! I guess he just wanted to monologue, and my input could take a jolly hike.\r\n\r\n“I’m Papilion, the God of Change,” she grandly announced, to an audience of one – and that constant shifting of male to female, young to old, pleased to outraged made a bit more sense, although it was giving me a pounding headache to follow. “And you’re being reincarnated. Normally, as souls are reincarnated through the cycle of life and death, all of their memories are erased. They’re given a clean slate to start over. I don’t know what to make of you, a lone soul lost to Samsara, so you have the option of keeping some of your memories. Regrettably, a newborn’s mind is simply too small for all of the things you know, and you do know quite a few dangerous things. What is your choice? Would you like to start as a blank slate, a new life? Or keep some of your knowledge, some of who you are, knowing that you’ll never be able to go back, be forever incomplete, missing a part of yourself?”\r\n\r\nI wasn’t ready to make a decision of this scale. Hell, 10 minutes ago by my reckoning, I was debating what to eat for lunch, deciding if I wanted to buy that dress or not, and figuring out how to get all my homework done!\r\n\r\nPoof! Like a magician’s disappearing act, it was all gone! A mote of dust in the breeze, smoke wrapped in the wind, the last ember soaked in water.\r\n\r\nMy entire life was over. Everything I’d worked for and accomplished gone in a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nThe crushing weight of that threatened to overwhelm me, but then the absurdity hit.\r\n\r\nI was dead. It wasn’t like I could make any worse choices now, could I?\r\n\r\nWhat was the worst that could happen now?\r\n\r\nOn one hand, I could keep my memories. Sounded painful, more emotional than physical. I would lose everyone I had ever known – my parents, my best friend, my brother, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends – everyone. I would know it. I would be aware. It was like a plague went through and I had to attend a hundred funerals at once, but the only funeral anyone would be attending was mine. The option to just… forget… was tempting, especially if it was as thorough as removing the memory of me dying was.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it sounded like this was a rare chance. Not everyone got to keep their memories – even if it was only a fraction of them – and start over again, tabula rasa. It was tempting, just for the aspect of doing something nobody – wait, maybe this had happened before – had done.\r\n\r\n“Can… can I ask some questions….?” I asked, getting a single arched eyebrow back as a response. That might be a “go ahead”, but it might also be a “you dare question me mortal”, and I wasn’t going to play games with my life. Err… afterlife? Soul? Reincarnation?\r\n\r\nI decided not to ask any questions, and mull it over myself. There wasn’t much more to add.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I felt that the choice was forced. As some famous philosopher said “You die twice. Once when you die, and once when someone speaks your name for the last time.” I might have died and lost my first body, but my soul and memories were intact. That was alive enough for me, and I fully intended to keep it that way. I was too young to die.\r\n\r\n“I would like to keep my memories.” I said with far more confidence than I felt. The god in front of me smiled as he started to morph into a strange bird – it looked like a crow, but it had too many feet. Somehow, his voice was all the same coming out of a beak.\r\n\r\n“Right then. Chemistry, gone. Physics, gone. Far too dangerous to know that where you’re going. Scientific method – you can do too much damage with that. Broad strokes of history – fine, but the details are completely superfluous, and we need to make room. Mathematics – keep the basics, but calculus will do nothing for you where you’re headed. Arts, literature – useless, but removing it will change you too much. There’s not much point in letting you keep your memories if you’re a completely different person. Interpersonal relationships – they can stay, same reason. English – I suppose you need a starting baseline. French? Spanish? Entirely useless. Gone. Hmm… a few more things to clean up… and we’re done! Prepare to be reincarnated as a Golden Crow.”\r\n\r\nI felt the strange force from before entering my mind, magnitudes more powerful and painful than before, rooting around in my head. Each time the crow squawked, I felt something rip out from my mind, and I tried to hold back tears of pain. By the time math was gone – I never liked it, but was indescribably sad at it leaving – I was curled up on the floor weeping silently. Not that there was a floor, just more floating in space. But when he said ‘Prepare to be reincarnated as a Golden Crow” I shot up, panic racing through me, somehow about to speak again.\r\n\r\n“NO! I WANT TO BE HUMAN! MAKE ME HUMAN! HUMA-“\r\n\r\nA pair of fingers snapped.\r\n\r\nI was floating in warm, wet darkness. I had been floating here for quite some time, and I was doing lots of thinking. My first instinct was that it was all a bad dream, but I had fallen asleep and woken up too often for that to be the case. So, it seemed like I had truly died, and was being reincarnated.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I was unsure about was if I was going to be human, a ‘Golden Crow’, whatever that was, or something else entirely. This whole reincarnation thing really needed a user manual or something. I didn’t seem to have a shell, but there was no telling really.\r\n\r\nAt least, I was pretty sure something called a crow would be hatched from an egg. Who knew what I actually knew and what got ripped out by that cruel, capricious god. Who knew what was real, and what I just made up on my own as I floated here in the dark, trying desperately to plug the holes in my memories, holes where I knew things should be but were not.\r\n\r\nI wanted to go home. I wanted to see mom again. I wanted dad to hug me, to tell me everything was going to be ok. Maybe I could look them up on the internet when I was old enough, tell them that I was ok. Would they even believe me? Would they think it’s just some cruel hoax?\r\n\r\nI could probably tell them enough about me, enough about them, growing up. How the sun hit the windows, how it would go through the crude ‘stained glass’ plastic I made in 4th grade. That Becky was my best friend until 2nd grade, when she moved. How our dog Aoife used to eat anything and everything – proven by the Great Banana Peel Experiment – and was taken too soon. What was an ‘experiment’ anyways?\r\n\r\nThe fact that some knowledge was considered “too dangerous” for where I was going implied that I wasn’t heading back to the time I came from. I thinly tried to hold on hope that Papilion had meant “too dangerous to be born knowing so much”, but I knew I was just deluding myself. I grieved. I lamented. I cursed fate, cursed the gods. It changed nothing. They were most likely all lost to me.\r\n\r\nWaking period by waking period, the details of my past life got dulled, along with the pain of losing everyone I knew. Random things stayed – like why did I still know my bus schedule? How did that stay, why didn’t it get stripped out? Others faded. I could only name half of the people in my biology class, I had no idea who my teachers were last year, and the details of the latest book I had been reading were gone.\r\n\r\nGod, I wanted to read again. To pick up a book, sit in a cozy chair by the fire, and just lose myself in the pages. Rarely was I so happy as when I was reading. Although, “God” might be a bit of a strange epithet, after now knowing there were gods, and it didn’t seem like there was just one. Otherwise he (she? Them? What pronoun did a shape-shifting god (goddess??) use anyways? – I decided to use he, since that was the first and the last form shown to save my sanity until said god of change told me otherwise.) probably wouldn’t have referred to himself as “the god of change”, and probably just “god”. God. This was tricky.\r\n\r\nI had entirely too much time to think, and nothing else to do. I tried flailing about now and then, just for a change of pace, but I rapidly hit soft walls all around me that absorbed what I did and gave. I tried to brace myself and push out, but had no luck. I would rapidly tire out and fall asleep after each attempt.\r\n\r\nI kept at it though, because there was nothing else to do. Except think. And there was nobody to bounce my thoughts off of, nobody to interact with, and just far too much time on my hands (claws? Please not claws.) God. Gods.\r\n\r\nI occasionally heard noises, as if coming off from a great distance underwater, but couldn’t make anything out. I would redouble my escape efforts whenever I heard that – maybe someone could let me out? But it never made a difference. The noises were usually soothing, which was nice, but being unable to really make anything out, it wasn’t that much of a change. At least it broke up the monotony. Inevitably after each attempt, I would get exhausted and fall asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen would this end?\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs couldn’t last, and one day I felt the fleshy walls of my prison contract around me, squeezing me. I felt a sharp spike of fear go through me, and I flailed more in panic. There wasn’t anything else I could do. This did seem to strongly imply that I didn’t need to escape with a beak, which gave me a brief sense of relief – only for panic to set in once again as the walls contracted around me, squeezing all over. Again, and again, pain and pause, the relief between each movement constantly shortened. I was battered, I felt bruised all over, but finally, with one last massive squeeze, I emerged into the world, and a massive deluge of information.\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Welcome to Pallos!]\r\n\r\n[Name: Elaine]\r\n\r\n[Race: Human]\r\n\r\n[Age: 0]\r\n\r\n[Time remaining on System locks: 68,820:43:16]\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Due to the great efforts of [Hero] Herculix, you get a +1 bonus to all stats! You also get a passive 2% increase to all exp gain!]\r\n\r\nStrange words floating in front of me, and so many more words, dozens, hundreds! I needed to investigate. But more than that –\r\n\r\nGiants. Giants all around me. Some yelling, some screaming, two covered in blood. The noise grated, and went right between my ears, nails on chalkboard. I was picked up, incomprehensible language babbled all around me, and looking down, I saw a female giant bleeding profusely. Another giantess elbowed her way in, put her hand on the first giant, yelled something, and I watched the flesh of the first giant knit itself back together!\r\n\r\nHoly shitballs there was magic here!\r\n\r\nI looked up for the first time, and realized that we were in a field under the open sky. I was passed down to the giantess who was healed, my head being moved around as I saw more of the night sky, and I saw them.\r\n\r\nTwo crimson cat’s eyes with slitted pupils glared down from the sky to me, watching me, seeing every movement I made. I could feel the weight of its ominous gaze pressing on me, suffocating. The strange floating words, being manhandled by giants, the screaming, getting battered and bruised, the blood, the magic - it was too much. I screamed and cried and flailed about, and didn’t stop until my voice gave out and I passed out from exhaustion.\r\n\r\n'),
('System Day II', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 3, '\r\n\r\nDad came home, had dinner, wished me luck on System Day, got out of his armor, and went directly to sleep. In that order. The last two items had occasionally been mixed up. Mom always made me rewash the sheets when it happened, and I’d quickly learned to intercept dad before he could sleep in his armor.\r\n\r\nWashing sheets SUCKED.\r\n\r\nTime was funny without clocks. Things weren’t done at a particular time, just “Around noon” “Before dark” “Right after sunrise”. After so long of not needing to deal with being exactly on time to things, it was easy to slide right into the new way of handling time. It did make starting important things – like System Day – a bit tricky, but such was the way of life.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t figure out why my System clock was measured in hours – the same hours as on Earth – but nobody seemed to use hours, nor did I even know the name for it here! Learning the new language had been hard. I didn’t want to ask about time and hours and such – I could always let the reincarnated genie out of the bottle, but there was no putting it back. It wasn’t like I was keeping it a massive “don’t tell at any cost” secret, but I figured there was a time and a place for everything.\r\n\r\n“Elaine. Sit.” Mom gestured to the chair, comb in hand. I happily scuttled up onto the recliner, where mom started to comb my hair. It was peaceful, relaxing, stroke after stroke getting my hair out and loose. A moment of peace. A moment of calm. A perfect mother-daughter moment.\r\n\r\n“Excited?” Mom asked, getting a particularly difficult snarl out.\r\n\r\n“Yeah!” This was IT! This was the big day! “I can’t wait to try all of the things in the temple out! I want to know everything!”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMom smiled. “Don’t get your hopes up too high, it’s fairly disappointing really.”\r\n\r\nLearning about magic, disappointing? Yikes. I hope I didn’t have all the fun sucked out of me when I grew up. At long last. Growing up was taking me literally twice as long as the normal person, thankyouverymuch reincarnation.\r\n\r\nJust as I’d started to taste the fun and joys of being an adult, ziiiiiip! Back to square one! If it hadn’t been for the trippy stars and gods nonsense, I would’ve sworn someone had it in for me!\r\n\r\nBut nooooooo. I’d been a clerical error! A typo!!\r\n\r\nHair finished up, I grabbed my sandals, and off we went! We left the house, looked both ways, and crossed over to the “grey zone” of the street. I frowned.\r\n\r\n“Moooooom, can we not walk here? It’s System Day! I’m allowed to walk in the real street now!”\r\n\r\nMom gave me that half amused, half exasperated smile. “I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”\r\n\r\nI gave her my best angry-pout.\r\n\r\n“Because I don’t have enough physical stats.” I recited as annoyingly as I could.\r\n\r\n“That’s right. And when has ‘not being allowed’ ever stopped you or Lyra from anything, hmm?”\r\n\r\nOops. Good point.\r\n\r\nI pouted as I was dragged along. I wanted to be on the real street, instead of the tiny grey zone. It was full of other kids, crates, and generally things pushed to the side. It seemed to be a universal law that bike lanes were treated poorly. I hated having to crawl over and around things, when I could be in the nice “white zone” instead, strolling through without a care in the world.\r\n\r\nOut of the clear blue sky, a massive series of thunderbolts came down near the south gate, making me jump about a foot out of my skin.\r\n\r\n“What was that!?” I yelled, startled. Lightning bolts didn’t just come out of the clear blue sky. No way.\r\n\r\nNot even in this world of MAGIC! Most of what I’d seen had been on the smaller end. Plates instantly cleaned. People working faster, hitting harder. I hadn’t seen any super-duper-cool magic like LIGHTNING BOLTS OUTTA NOWHERE!\r\n\r\nBut… maybe I had?\r\n\r\nI wasn’t the only one who’d jumped. Multiple huge surprise lightning bolts tended to do that to people.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think it was, Elaine?\" Mom asked me with that annoying \'I\'m trying to teach you something\' tone of voice parents had.\r\n\r\nI bit my lower lip and thought about it.\r\n\r\n\"A... Classer entering the city?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nMom nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Why did he make some Lightning bolts?\"\r\n\r\nOh! OH! I knew this one! Dad had told me!\r\n\r\n\"They ask mage Classers to discharge their mana before coming in!\" I exclaimed, jumping one in my excitement. Dad was SUPER GUARD! He told me cool guard stuff like that!\r\n\r\nAnd, and, someone could just flat-out summon Lightning bolts! That was MAGIC! YES!\r\n\r\nA thought came to me.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell how much mana someone has?”\r\n\r\n“It’s usually safe to assume that mages have a lot of mana.” Mom said, and I wanted to roll my eyes.\r\n\r\nDUH mages had mana!! What else would they have? Even with the great “don’t tell kids stuff” conspiracy going on, that seemed suuuuuuuuuper obvious to me.\r\n\r\n“The guards have a rough idea of how much mana mages of a certain level should have. However, it’s something of a trust system. Mages show that they can follow the rules, so they’re let in.”\r\n\r\nI guess?\r\n\r\nWe reached the end of the street, and turned left into the main street. You could see the town gate on one end, and the market at the center of town on the other. Well – you could see it if there weren’t food stands, vendors, two wagon-wide worth of lanes, and a massive crush of people in the way.\r\n\r\nMagic was on display in hundreds of tiny ways. Shops had their flashing signs, food rotated on spits without anyone touching them, goods moved through the air by themselves, and a broken wagon was repaired by a passing man touching it.\r\n\r\nEveryone had magic, usually small, and used it in their day to day life.\r\n\r\nI’d seen the sight a THOUSAND times, and there were still a THOUSAND COOL THINGS TO SEE! Every day had something new and different!\r\n\r\n“Mom Mom Mom look! They’re selling pitas! And a bard’s playing over on the corner! Can we go over and listen? Please? Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease?”\r\n\r\nMom rolled her eyes at me “You’re as distractible as always Elaine. Where are we going right now?”\r\n\r\n“The temple!”\r\n\r\n“And why are we going there?”\r\n\r\nRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“SYSTEM DAY!!! Let’s go-go-go-go slowpoke”\r\n\r\nShe chuckled as I started pulling on her hand and arm, urging her forward. I knew she could run and go so much faster than this, why were we plodding along?\r\n\r\nI suddenly stumbled and nearly fell over as a blast of wind hit me. Fortunately, mom was holding onto me, and kept me stable and up. My heart was pounding so loudly I could almost hear it. My palms felt like they were going to slip out of mom’s tight grasp.\r\n\r\nMom looked down at me with a hint of worry in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“That was a courier. And that is why we’re still walking in the grey zone. You could barely stand the air blast of him running by – imagine if he hadn’t seen you in the crowd and ran into you at that speed? That would be bad.”\r\n\r\nI imagined a large, rolling rock and a small, delicate mango in the way. Splat. Yeah no.\r\n\r\nMy heart was getting back down to a more reasonable rate.\r\n\r\n“I’m never leaving the grey zone. Nuh uh. No way.” I swore.\r\n\r\nI climbed up and over another crate while mom deftly weaved from the grey zone into the white zone and back again to avoid it. I could smell the marketplace, and now I could finally see it. It was a large, sprawling mess in the middle of town, with the Athahurst river pressed up against one side of it. Guards were patrolling around with their leather vests and metal batons, merchants were hawking their wares under covered stalls, shooting off impressive displays of magic to try and attract attention – pillars of flames, living sculptures of water, flashing light signs, and so much more. The usual army recruiter was shouting his pitch – “Join the legions today! Fight the Formorians! Service grants citizenship!” A large crowd of people moved throughout, going from stall to stall to do their daily shopping, find something nice, or just to chit-chat. The sky went dark, and everyone froze where they were, merchant to farmer, young to old, man and woman, looking to the sky. Street kids didn’t even take the chance of distraction to nick a purse or two – they were too busy looking up as well.\r\n\r\nJust a crapton of pigeons. They were so shitty to have around. Literally, they pooped everywhere. There was a collective sigh, as the market resumed being as busy as a beehive.\r\n\r\nThe market was too narrow and too crowded for there to be grey zones, and it was somewhat dangerous for someone as small as I was for a reason. Fortunately, with the crowd, and everyone stopping and starting every three feet it was safe for me. It clearly wasn’t stopping some of the street kids I saw ducking and weaving about, looking for unguarded wares and purses. I eyed them suspiciously. Mom might not be paying too much attention, but I was. No sticky-fingered brat was getting mom’s pouch – and by extension, my lunch.\r\n\r\nWith supernatural agility mom worked her way through the crowd, and we reached the shores of the Athahurst. We ended up close to the south bridge, with a pair of surly guards stopping enterprising merchants from setting up on the bridge itself.\r\n\r\nWe started to cross the bridge when mom, twisting with unnatural finesse, punted a wind weasel that had been blowing towards us.\r\n\r\n“Bloody pests,” she muttered, putting me back down. “What is the guard doing that there’s so many of them running around?”\r\n\r\n“You should complain to dad that he is not doing his job.” I cheekily replied, only to get walloped over the head.\r\n\r\nI rubbed my head, and waited until mom had turned before glaring at her.\r\n\r\nGlaring over her shoulders at the bridge guards, muttering darkly under her breath, we continued marching over the bridge. This was exciting! System day! Some old men we wearing tunics of various hues of red and blue were fishing on the bridge.\r\n\r\n“Hey mom! Can we go fishing here later!?” Trout and salmon and ok fine I didn’t actually know the names of any of the fish here. A fish was a fish. Yum Yum.\r\n\r\nI got a sad smile back.\r\n\r\n“No dear. Who’s allowed to fish here again?” My face fell at this.\r\n\r\n“Citizens…” I muttered back, still glaring murder at the two fishermen. The JERKS were allowed to fish here and I wasn’t.\r\n\r\nMom, clearly seeing I was upset, tried to cheer me up. “Besides, the fishing here is pretty bad – there’s almost nothing in the river because of the grates.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not fair that we’re not citizens! Dad should be a citizen, the army recruiter said they become citizens and he is a guard! I want to be a citizen!” I whined.\r\n\r\n“Even if dad was a citizen…” Mom started, trailing off.\r\n\r\nShe knew me too well.\r\n\r\nWe weren’t allowed to be citizens. Ever since the day I’d learned that simply being born a girl made me a second class citizen, a roaring bonfire of rage and anger had been lit inside of me. It fueled me, drove me. No matter how many times I got punched and kicked, I leaned on that anger and always, always got back up.\r\n\r\nMom was always good with the patients who came to visit her, and could probably tell I was still upset.\r\n\r\n“Look Elaine, while you can’t be a citizen, you could always marry one! It’s practically the same thing.”\r\n\r\nThe only thing that did was to stroke the fire inside of me, and make me mad again. Mom had told me that before, and it just didn’t help.\r\n\r\nAt all. I wasn’t going to marry no stinky boy just to get second-rate citizenship. Bah!\r\n\r\nCalm, calm, I need to stay calm. I need to stay in control. I can’t just go flying off the handle, and the temple was practically in sight.\r\n\r\nSystem Day. Mangos. Lyra. Magic. Happy thoughts.\r\n\r\nAs I was seeing red and taking some deep stabilizing breaths, we reached the end of the bridge and arrived in front of the temple. It was the largest building I had seen since I had been reborn, and looked like it had been a clone of a Greek temple, with large steps leading up to majestic marble pillars. I stopped and stared for a moment, taking it all in, before noticing a statue in front of the building. Flesh in marble, done by such a skilled [Sculptor] that he looked alive, a large lizard-like creature stood hunched forward on its hind legs, a jaw like a crocodile with a smile like one, claws made for rending and tearing, and a huge sail on its back.\r\n\r\nWe reverently bowed towards the statue of Etalix, the Storm. One of the guardian beasts. No idea what a guardian beast was or what they did, but I was taking no chances. Not with the gods being real, and seemingly taking an active interest in our day to day lives.\r\n\r\nUntil I had an answer, I wasn’t going to stop paying my respects to Etalix. Just in case.\r\n\r\nEtalix, the Storm.\r\n\r\nEtalix, the Spinosaurus.\r\n\r\nThere were freaking DINOSAURS here!\r\n\r\n'),
('System Day III', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 4, '\r\n\r\nWe entered the temple together, and I looked around in awe. I wasn’t particularly religious - somewhat ironic, considering I’d met an actual god - but the temple was impressive, no matter how many times I saw it.\r\n\r\nThere were marble pillars, and in the middle of the entryway, a large diamond-shaped symbol, with a gemstone on each corner and one in the middle. Painted frescos lined the wall: What was probably Etalix, wrapped in mist. Herculix fighting some sort of large dinosaur. White Dove and Black Crow, the grim reapers from above. Army legions victorious over large insects. The famous run of Fulguris. The Sentinel Gideon, burning with the dark flames he was famous for. And many, many more, each probably with historical significance and martial victory that someone would probably be all too happy to tell me about if I asked. I didn’t ask.\r\n\r\nI wanted to read about it! No books, just nice scrolls, and even then nobody had any ideas of teaching me how to read. I’d have to do it myself one day.\r\n\r\n“Good morning.” A man with a pockmarked face, marking him as a survivor of any number of the poxes and plagues that went about regularly, greeted us. “Are you here for System Day?” He asked with exceeding politeness.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” I responded as enthusiastically as I could, although not as loudly as possible. The temple was intimidating. At the same time, mom gave a much more reserved “Yes”. I glared at her with all the ferocity I could muster. It was my day. No stealing it!\r\n\r\n“Third door on the left.” He gently told us.\r\n\r\nWith bold strides and butterflies bouncing in my belly, I entered the indicated room. There were three other kids in beige sitting on the floor in front of an older priestly-looking gentleman in a chair, and there were various implements scattered around the edge of the room. There was a bowl of water, a hammer, a rope, and dozens more little objects scattered all over. There was even a modest patch of dirt! At the back of the room, prominently displayed, was another one of those diamonds with 5 gems in it, but much smaller. I looked around puzzled as everyone’s attention came around to me.\r\n\r\n“Hello there. I’m Sacerdus. What’s your name?”\r\n\r\nI got a warm fuzzy feeling from the elderly priest standing at the front of the room. He was tall, in a long white robe with simple sandals on his feet. White hair, white beard, and it was clear he spent time in the sun, he practically radiated comfort, confidence, and relaxation. Heck, for all I knew, he literally was radiating all of those!\r\n\r\n“I’m Elaine.” I fidgeted, eyes on the floor.\r\n\r\n“Well Elaine, why don’t you sit down with everyone else? We’ll get started soon.”\r\n\r\nI looked around, and saw Lyra! How did I miss her first-time round? Her somewhat tattered tunic made her stand out, the victim of one of her many fights. She clearly saw me as well, and jumped up to hug me!\r\n\r\n“Lyra!” I exclaimed, completely forgetting where we were.\r\n\r\n“Elaine!” Just as happily.\r\n\r\n“Ahem.” A cough came from Sacerdus. Mom was glaring murder at me. Oh gods I was going to get the spoon later.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I was spared further conversation as a boy wearing a green tunic and his father came in.\r\n\r\n“Hello there. I’m Sacerdus. What’s your name?” Sacerdus said again, without any sign of impatience or annoyance.\r\n\r\nThe boy drew himself up to his full height, and with all the haughtiness he could muster responded with “Olympus Kerberos Titus.” I rolled my eyes to myself as he strutted forward, and plonked himself down in front of all of us. Um, hello? The remaining four of us are sitting in a line, who are you to sit in front of us all? Should I say something? But Sacerdus isn’t saying anything, he’s just keeping his happy smile on.\r\n\r\nAs I was debating what to do, Sacerdus preempted me by talking.\r\n\r\n“Well! I’m glad to see everyone’s here. Just checking – everyone has less than seven days left on their timer? Raise your hand if you do!” He said as he raised his hand in demonstration.\r\n\r\n64 hours and change left. Yup, that was me! Strange that he didn’t say it in hours, although nobody here seemed to use them. I raised my hand with everyone else.\r\n\r\n“Good! Let’s begin. First, I’d like to say thank you to Kerberos’s father, Citizen Prasinos. He, and Citizen Arotro and Citizen Fyto together grow about three in ten crops that we eat here in Aquiliea.” He gestured to three men standing in the back in full purple robes.\r\n\r\nThe three citizens in the back nodded thanks at the acknowledgement.\r\n\r\nSacerdus turned around, and grabbed a scroll off of the altar.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to start by something our history off of the something.”\r\n\r\nI was still learning words. Sue me, I was a kid, and hadn’t gotten exposed to everything yet. However, it was easy enough to figure new words out from context!\r\n\r\nHe unraveled the scroll, and started reading off of it. “It’s currently 4788 years post-creation. In the beginning, the five major gods created…” I completely missed everything else he said – at long last, I had the word for reading, and the word for scroll! It wasn’t a book, but I could now finally ask for reading lessons! Books would have to be involved, and then I could finally read again!\r\n\r\nI hadn’t seen Lyra in ages (ok fine two days), and we spent some time putting our heads together, whispering frantically to get caught up.\r\n\r\n“Did you get in trouble for the…?” I started. I didn’t need to finish the sentence; Lyra knew exactly what I was referring to. The latest Incident. The reason it had been two whole days since last seeing the other half of my soul.\r\n\r\n“Nope!” She cheekily grinned.\r\n\r\n“Lucky.” I muttered back. “You NEVER get in trouble for ANYTHING.”\r\n\r\nWhich was true. No matter how bad the situation, no matter what we got up to, it was one of the fundamental truths of the world that mom would punish me, and Lyra got away free.\r\n\r\n“Any questions?” he asked. Shit. I had completely missed everything he said! This was System Day! I needed to focus! I did my best poker face, hoping that I hadn’t missed anything, and more importantly, mom hadn’t noticed me whispering with Lyra.\r\n\r\n“Good. Moving on. We don’t know where the System comes from, but it’s what gives us classes and skills. It’s what lets us stay alive in this world. It’s the foundation of nearly everything we do, and we’d fall prey to the creatures outside of our borders without it. Even with it, we’re at risk. Everyone needs to do their part so humanity as a whole can survive, and maybe even beat the Formorians.”\r\n\r\nFormorians. The villain of every story, the scourge seemingly lurking around every corner. The big monster, threatening to overrun us at any time.\r\n\r\nI’d never seen one. When I was with dad I occasionally saw a bunch of new soldier recruits marching out of the city, and once in a while an old soldier came back. There was a war, but it wasn’t near us.\r\n\r\n“Nearly everything has a System. Anything bigger than a bug has a system, although it seems like only humans and intelligent monsters get classes. As you’ve all noticed,” he chuckled “when you’re born, your System is locked. Humans all have the same timer, but it seems like monsters each get their own, different timer. Why this is, we don’t know, but we believe it’s to stop babies from killing themselves.” Sacerdus went from smiling to serious. “If you get nothing else out of System Day, just know that improperly using the System and allocating your traits can and will kill you. Each time you level up a physical trait, you lose some of your mana regeneration. If you allow your mana regeneration to dip below 0, you’ll start to burn mana just to stay alive. You’ll quickly hit 0 mana, and then your body will eat itself from the inside out. It’s not pretty. It’s not fun. It’s Very Bad.” He emphasized, talking to us like we were children.\r\n\r\nWhich we were. Fair enough.\r\n\r\nSacerdus repeated himself, along with dire warnings about allocating stats.\r\n\r\n“Any questions?”\r\n\r\nI looked over my stats.\r\n\r\n[Free Stats: 0]\r\n\r\n[Strength: 4]\r\n\r\n[Dexterity: 6]\r\n\r\n[Vitality: 3]\r\n\r\n[Speed: 4]\r\n\r\n[Mana: 2]\r\n\r\n[Mana Regeneration:2]\r\n\r\n[Magic Power: 2]\r\n\r\n[Magic Control: 2]\r\n\r\nI had nothing.\r\n\r\n“Carrying on. There are two types of stats, broadly speaking. There are the stats you get and build yourself, the ‘natural’ stats. And the stats you get from classes and leveling, the ‘class’ stats. For the most part, you can’t control your natural stats, and they’ll only form a very minor portion of your stats. However, as a benefit, they don’t drain any mana. Otherwise very few of us would survive our System unlocking.”\r\n\r\nI spent a moment daydreaming and thinking over what was said before realizing Sacerdus was talking again. Shit. I couldn’t miss this, not when lacking information could kill me it seemed. Stupid kid brain.\r\n\r\n“… to recap, each point of mana regeneration gives you about 240 mana per day of regeneration. Each point you allocate to Strength, Dexterity, Vitality, or Speed will use about 24 mana per day worth of that regeneration.”\r\n\r\nI mentally translated that to about 10 mana/hour gained per point and 1 mana/hour lost per physical stat.\r\n\r\n“Let’s talk about the stat groupings.”\r\n\r\n“We have the four physical stats – Strength, Dexterity, Vitality and Speed. We then have the four magic stats – Mana, Mana Regen, Magic Power, and Magic Control. Any questions?”\r\n\r\nHeads shaking.\r\n\r\n“Next, we have the support stats and the direct stats. The direct stats directly help in fights, and the support stats simply help out.”\r\n\r\n“The four direct stats are Strength, Dexterity, Magic Power, and Magic Control. As a result, the four support stats are Vitality, Speed, Mana, and Mana Regeneration. Any questions?” The distinction seemed fairly arbitrary to me, but whatever, I would roll with it.\r\n\r\n“Good. Let’s talk about each individual stat now.”\r\n\r\n“Strength. Strength is how strong you are, how much you can lift, how powerfully you can swing a sword, how far you can draw a bow. It’s both how high you can lift a hammer, and how many times you can lift a hammer. It’s power, it’s stamina, it’s strength.”\r\n\r\n“Dexterity. Dexterity is how flexible you are, how gracefully you can move. Dexterity is the fine control over yourself, and over your movements. It’s how well you can etch pottery. It’s how accurate your arrow is. It’s how you balance as you walk. As it combines with Strength, it’s how accurately you hit the metal you’re forging, it’s how well-placed your blow against a Formorian is. Dexterity is grace. Dexterity is beauty.”\r\n\r\n“Vitality. Vitality is how well-put together you are. It’s thick skin. It’s health. It’s living a long life. It’s staving off disease. It’s how well you perceive the world around you. Vitality is recovering from injuries, recovering from a punch, easily bearing a child.”\r\n\r\nI frowned. It seemed more subtle than Strength or Dexterity. I guess that is why it was a support stat, and not a direct stat. Still, everything was useful. With great effort, I continued to pay attention.\r\n\r\n“Lastly in the physical stats we have speed. Speed is how fast you run. Speed is how fast your blade is. Speed is how quick your reflexes are. Speed is reaction, speed is how quickly you can make food, speed is how fast you set up your stall.” Sacerdus looked at the boy on the far side of the line, opposite to me. “Speed is how fast you run away with a purse.” He looked guilty for some reason.\r\n\r\n“Speed and Vitality need each other like Strength and Dexterity need each other, even though they oppose each other. You can get a ton of speed, but it’s useless without the perception granted by Vitality to keep up. In other words, if you had a ton of Speed but no Vitality, you literally wouldn’t be able to see yourself running.”\r\n\r\n“Now we’ll talk about the four magic stats. The magic stats are how all of your skills work.”\r\n\r\n“Mana. Mana is the fuel for your skills. Without enough mana, you can’t use the skill! Usually, you’ll be told how much a skill costs, and if you have enough mana, you can cast it! If you have lots and lots of mana, you can cast many many spells and skills at once! For every one point you put into mana, you get 10 points into your mana pool.”\r\n\r\nSeemed straightforward.\r\n\r\n“Mana regeneration is both how much mana you recover, and how the rest of your skills are fueled. Each point of mana regeneration gives you 240 mana per day of regeneration, and those points of mana per day of regeneration are how you fuel your physical skills. You can focus on physical stats, and use skills less often, or you can have fewer physical stats and be able to cast spells more often. However, you’re still limited by your mana pool for how many skills you can cast at once! Physical stats let you keep working for the entire day, but each activity isn’t as impressive as a skill.”\r\n\r\n“If you have questions, ask your parents later.” Sacerdus smiled at us. “I know this is a lot, but take some time to think about it, and ask later. This is supposed to be an introduction – after all, your parents know much better than you or I do what you should do!”\r\n\r\n“Magic power,” Sacerdus plowed on. “is how powerful skills can be, and how much mana a single skill can use. Many skills can use more mana the higher your magic power is. For example, the legion’s famous [Earthen Artillery] skill gets bigger the more mana you pour into it.”\r\n\r\nGot it. More magic power = bigger fireballs. Really all that mattered.\r\n\r\n“Lastly is Magic Control. This is how finely you can control your skills, how well you can weave them. If a sculptor wanted to use his [Fine Engraving] skill to make detailed work into a wall, he’d need a very high Magic Control level to make a fine, delicate pattern. For girls, a [Weave Lace] skill will get you finer and finer lace the higher your Magic Control skill is.”\r\n\r\nI wasn’t going to spend my precious time and magic making lace. Although, thinking about it, maybe I could get a skill to help with my hair.\r\n\r\n“To recap. Magic power is how powerful your skills can be. Magic control is how well you can control your skills. Mana controls your mana pool, and mana regen fuels it all”\r\n\r\n“Now, to finish this all off, I need to let you know about trade-offs. For every 8 points in Magic Power you get, you’ll lose a point of Magic Control. For every 8 points of Magic Control you get, you’ll lose a point of Magic Power. The same is true for Strength and Dexterity. For every eight points of Strength, you’ll lose one of Dexterity, and vice-versa. This only applies to the ‘class’ stats – your ‘natural’ stats don’t change. Any questions?”\r\n\r\nA flurry of questions erupted from the other kids, while I sat and pondered the System. It really did seem like you could be physical, and quite good at it, or magical, while weak physically. Could you do both? Would it be worse than either? How did I want to build my stats? If I wanted to be Elaine, the [Archmage], probably deep into the Magic stats. But did I want to focus on power, or control? Big mana pools, or good regen? Or could I have it all? Arghhh… I needed to know more. First reading. Then books. Then plotting. Then…. I swear I could feel steam coming out of my ears as I tried to digest everything I had just been given.\r\n');

('System Day IV', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 5, '\r\n\r\n“Ok! Now that we have that out of the way, let’s talk about elements!” Elements? Ooooh, more cool things! I wanted a fire element! Fireballs!\r\n\r\nI’d seen a few merchants having flaming signs in the marketplace, Fire totally HAD to be an element.\r\n\r\n“Each Class has an associated element with it. For the most part, any element can go with any class, but most classes benefit from having particular elements. For example, you could have [Courier] be an Earth class, but he’d most likely benefit from having a Wind class instead.”\r\n\r\nElements leaned into things. Particular jobs wanted particular elements. Easy enough.\r\n\r\n“Something like a [Blacksmith] could have fire, and have skills related to forges and heat. They could have an earth element, and deal with molds and the furnace. Metal would naturally be one of the most useful, probably getting some direct manipulation skills. Water is rarely seen with a blacksmith, but it could help with quenching. Wind is also pretty rare with a blacksmith, but they’d move faster, and have sharper weapons.” Elements! Fire. My eyes were blazing with rapt focus.\r\n\r\n“The Elements come in four pairs of two, and they’re paired up equal and opposite just like the stats they help. They are: Fire and Water; Earth and Wind; Light and Dark; Wood and Metal. Fire goes with Strength. That means if your class is Fire-aligned, for each level in the class you get, you’ll gain a point in Strength as well! Isn’t that neat!”\r\n\r\n“Fire is Strength. Water, opposing it, is Dexterity. Just like how getting points in Strength will eventually lower your Dexterity, Fire and Water oppose each other.”\r\n\r\n“Earth is Vitality, while Wind is Speed.”\r\n\r\n“Light is Mana Regeneration, while Darkness is Mana.”\r\n\r\n“Lastly, Wood is Magic Control, while Metal is Magic Power.”\r\n\r\nFyto spoke up at this moment. “Would you like a demonstration of skills and magic?”\r\n\r\nA mad chorus of yeses came from all of us except Kerberos. A chance to see magic performed for us? Yes please!\r\n\r\nFyto walked over to the patch of dirt, touched it with his foot, and intoned for our sake:\r\n\r\n“[Full Field Plow].”\r\n\r\nA ripple went over the field, turning the messy mud into neat rows of plowed earth, ready to be seeded.\r\n\r\nI’d seen magic before - everyone used it every day - but this seemed to be a step up from usual!\r\n\r\nArotro only gestured, and suddenly there were dozens of seeds that came from him, floating around the room. They playfully moved along the room, settling into neat rows on the plowed field.\r\n\r\nPrasinos lastly walked over, bent over – oh god that beautiful purple tunic better not touch dirt that would be a Major Sin – and spoke:\r\n\r\n“Watch carefully. This is what a [Rapid Growth] skill can do.”\r\n\r\nThe field exploded with growth. Squash, squash everywhere. I was amazed at the display of magic – real magic, not the small-time stuff the merchants did every day, and more amazed at how quickly the three of them had turned a patch of dirt into viable, tasty crops. And it was all done inside!\r\n\r\n“An amazing example of the Earth, Spore, and Verdant elements. There are a few more elements I didn’t mention, because they’re more advanced. Each pairing of primary elements creates a new, secondary element.”\r\n\r\nThat was – I did some quick thinking – a lot more elements.\r\n\r\n“Let’s talk about classes quickly before I let you run around and play.”\r\n\r\n“When the system unlocks, and as you advance, you’ll always have a class. It could be [Baker]. It could be [Soldier]. It could be [House Wife]. It could be bad, like [Thief]. You’ll usually have several options to choose from. You level up by doing things related to your class – in your case, simply being a child will level you up. Doing things outside of your class will also get you experience, but not as much as things inside of your class. Killing mean monsters will always get you lots of experience!”\r\n\r\n\"When your system unlocks, you’ll get your starter class automatically – it’ll probably be [Child of Remus] or [Child of Pallos], the first being much more common. You’ll gain a few levels, depending on what you’ve been doing since you were born, and when you finally get level 8, you’ll be able to get a new class! Exciting!”\r\n\r\n“We’re not sure on everything that decides a new class, but it seems to be based somewhat on your skills, what you’ve picked with them, and how high you’ve leveled them up. You will always have a choice when it comes to your non-starter classes. Listen to what your parents have to say, they should be able to get you a nice class to start with!”\r\n\r\n“Lastly, I’m sure you’re wondering why there are so many objects and things around the room. This is because of skills. Each class can have eight skills, and then you can have eight general skills on top of that. What skills you get, what skills you level, and how high you level them help determine what classes you’re offered. All of the things around the room are designed to get you started on various skills – if you start to make a pot out of clay, you’ll unlock the [Pottery] skill, and possibly even the [Ceramicist] class. If you swing a sword, you might get a fighting skill, and maybe even unlock the [Soldier Trainee] class if you’re very lucky! Lastly, trying many different things like this is almost guaranteed to get you the [Apprentice] class when you get to level 8, which will be useful for getting an apprenticeship.”\r\n\r\nSacerdus was saying something. I was too busy looking around. What stations did I want to try? The eight stations near the start made a lot more sense now – there was one for each element. Did that allow me to get some affinity for that element, unlocking the class? A pile of blocks, a block of clay, some dirty strips in a pile – lots of things for me to explore and try! It was clear now that I was supposed to try different things at different places, and pick up skills that way for my eventual leveling up! I chuckled as I rubbed my hands together, eager to start.\r\n\r\n“Now, girls, if you’ll leave, the boys can get started on the skills portion of today.” Kerberos leapt up with a happy cry, and immediately ran over to the swords. I just sat there stunned, trying to process what I had just heard.\r\n\r\nWhat. Completely stunned, visions of playing with hammers and blocks falling out of my mind, I didn’t resist at all as mom came over to pick me up. Perhaps sensing my inner turmoil, she picked me up and carried me out as thick, hot tears came spilling out of my eyes into her shoulder.\r\n\r\n“It’s not fair,” I choked out between sobs. “I wanted to play with all the things… and get skills.”\r\n\r\n“Shhh shhhh” Mom rocked me as she carried me back. “It’s ok. Hey, listen, let’s get you some food, and I’ll teach you some things that might turn into skills once we get back! Ok?”\r\n\r\nI furiously shook my head into her shoulder, sobbing my dreams out. Sensing the mood, mom continued to rock me and make soothing noises at me as we made it back across town to home. Coming inside, she laid me down on one of the recliners, and took my sandals off for me. I would normally complain about being treated like a baby, but I just didn’t care. What was the point of coming back with my memories intact, if I was just going to be stymied at every turn? What was the point of having magic, if it seemed like I wouldn’t be allowed to learn it? Mom picked me up and brought me to the bedroom, where she proceeded to tuck me in. Upset, exhausted, every bit of strength wrung out of me, I went to sleep.\r\n\r\nSystem Day sucked.\r\n'),
('Take off!', 'There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.', 2, '\r\n\r\nDelta counted again.\r\n\r\nBut no matter how many times she shook her head to clear her vision, her one goblin had become three.\r\n\r\nAlbeit it with some odd changes, the two new goblins stood about a half a foot taller than the one she created. They also had some odd tusks coming out the side of their mouth.\r\n\r\n“Mastah,” Gob bowed to the flow. He had a name, Delta could sense it and when she focused on him, she could feel a general… vibe coming from him. Compared to her goblin, he was stronger but not by much. Delta frowned.\r\n\r\n“I can just sense how strong someone is? Or is just goblins? I mean… goblins are a thing, so why not sensing power levels?” Delta argued with herself.\r\n\r\nHob, the brother, looked almost identical but acted more bashful\r\n\r\n“...aster,” he mumbled and Delta felt her unease grow. There was one other feeling she could feel coming off the two new goblins.\r\n\r\nA very Delta vibe. These goblins had a bit of her in them. Unlike her goblin, who needed a name that didn’t end in ‘ob’ felt fully like the floor and walls. Background, safe.\r\n\r\n“François?” she asked, plucking another name out of the air. It was a hard-earned talent that came from her many monster raising app games.\r\n\r\nThe orb pulsed. Delta understood that herself, the ghost state, was more like a projection of her mind. The orb was her ‘body’ so to speak. Delta tried to ignore how fragile the orb was and looked a lot more glowy than usual.\r\n\r\nFrançois stumbled forward, bowing.\r\n\r\n“Where did they come from?” Delta tried to push the question as clearly as she could towards Francois.\r\n\r\nDelta didn\'t think she could manage verbal communication in this state but as her orb glowed, she saw Francois stiffen. The ghost girl watched a vague slight orange glow fade from the goblin’s head. Some light seemed to simply slide off as if the power couldn’t find a suitable enough area to fulfil its purpose. Was that Delta’s lack of experience or the goblin’s mind just not able to convey her message?\r\n\r\nFrançois idly kicked at the dirt floor and looked a little nervous.\r\n\r\n“Saved from mans, wanted to serve, so sent them down,” François explained with a nervous hand wave. Hob and Gob nodded enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nDelta blinked.\r\n\r\n“Mans? Humans? Where are they now?” Delta wondered, wondering if any of them could help her.\r\n\r\n“Done! Dungeon food!” François boasted which made Delta pause.\r\n\r\n“You… François, what did you do?” Delta asked, a heavy feeling making her body freeze. François looked puzzled as she spoke.\r\n\r\n“Me and gobs smashed intruders. Save master,” he reported as if sheepish to forget such a thing.\r\n\r\n“You killed them?” Delta translated hollowly. She moved up the tunnel but saw nothing but a few bits of fabric just outside the tunnel entrance.\r\n\r\nA bit floated in and the dungeon ground it touched slightly glowed and the fabric melted away. A tiny mote of light floated up from the ex-piece of cloth and blinked out.\r\n\r\nDelta felt a little tingle flow through her mind and felt a little ill.\r\n\r\n“Mans smash crystal… or make it work like runt gob,” François tried to explain. Delta just looked at him, seeing with one eye through her orb. The double vision made her sick, so she closed both eyes and when she opened them, she was back at the orb room.\r\n\r\nHer room.\r\n\r\nFrançois words finally pierced her numb mind.\r\n\r\n“François, what am I?” she asked quietly and the goblin looked at his two new friends.\r\n\r\n“Dungeon Core! Mighty core that we protect!” he answered with pride. Hob and Gob danced as if the idea was wonderful.\r\n\r\nDelta looked around the room and then at her orb. She had made Francois. She had… spawned a mob. Delta swallowed back down some unintelligible noise and tried to hold on to something that didn’t end up with her screaming on the floor again.\r\n\r\n“What happens to the humans? When you… win?” she asked slowly. François looked unsure for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Losers feed dungeon master. All not-dungeon becomes mana for more dungeon,” he tried to explain, Hob and Gob listen as if learning from a master.\r\n\r\nDelta connected the dots. The extra glow in her orb, the lack of bodies. Delta avoided delving too deep into that thought and latched on to another.\r\n\r\nGroups of people meant more people. There was a good chance that at least one of the people that had… died upstairs had someone waiting for them and that meant that if they came looking…\r\n\r\nDelta looked at her orb. Then she remembered how she got here from that place with the demon-child. She was broken, then sundered. It wasn’t a journey. It was a warning.\r\n\r\n“François? How do I stop people from smashing me?” Delta demanded quickly and ignored how the internet has ruined that word.\r\n\r\nDamn Ron….\r\n\r\n“Traps! Monsters! Tricks!” François howled with delight. Delta frowned.\r\n\r\n“How do I know what I can build. I know I can build gobs…” she trailed off, not wanting to say goblins unless she auto made another goblin.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t know the rules and that made Delta edgy about spouting random words. If mana can come in, it could also completely leave her and drained her dry.\r\n\r\nShe had no idea what having no mana would do to her.\r\n\r\n“How do I know what I can make?” Delta asked with hope and Francois paused.\r\n\r\n“Just know,” he shrugged.\r\n\r\nDelta wanted to argue but the little goblin hadn’t lied yet. She took a few calming breaths and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat did she know? What did Delta, the dungeon core, know what she could do? She needed a list… or some semblance of a wiki. Delta opened her eyes and tried not to gasp. Her normal human vision had fallen away to reveal a complete 360 degree of view. It made her dizzy but in her moment of confusion, she saw it.\r\n\r\nA glowing button where the space at the back of her head would be.\r\n\r\nShe fumbled for it and it let loose a little jingle as it faded. Did that demon-bastard hide it there on purpose? Of course, he did…\r\n\r\nAs a mind, she shouldn’t be acting like she had human limits in this form. A lesson and reward.\r\n\r\nDelta hated that child.\r\n\r\nThe space to one side of her view opened up.\r\n\r\n    Construction\r\n    Monsters\r\n    Traps\r\n\r\nThere it was.\r\n\r\nThis was her power and her only way to stop people from… using her. If Francois was correct then people would see her as a rare treasure to be used or destroyed.\r\n\r\nDelta would accept neither, lest she ended up back in the demon-child’s hands.\r\n\r\nShe had to live. She had to survive…\r\n\r\nDelta hit the trap button. Maybe if she made her dungeon scary and dangerous, it might be left alone?\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t like people seriously risked their lives for some petty treasures or fights, right?\r\n\r\nDelta was silent for a moment and felt a sob rise up. Of course, they would, she used to make all her adventures do it in her games. If goblins were here, that meant people who removed goblins were also a thing.\r\n\r\n“François? Do dragons exist?” she asked quietly and the goblin nodded as if this was an odd question.\r\n\r\nHob spoke up.\r\n\r\n“Big hill far away has big fire lizard. Heard mans talk about it with fear,” he added, happy to contribute.\r\n\r\nDelta felt that little nugget of information settled into her stomach.\r\n\r\nIf dragons existed then so did unkillable, system-abusing, plot-protected heroes.\r\n\r\nDelta looked at her list.\r\n\r\n    Current mana: 20/20. Regen: 1 per day.\r\n\r\n    Traps:\r\n\r\n        Low-grade pitfall: 5 mana\r\n\r\nThat was all she had. Delta had a little hole to stop dragon-slayers.\r\n\r\nShe banged open the monster menu.\r\n\r\n    Monsters:\r\n\r\n        Goblins(chosen beginner monster): 10 mana\r\n\r\nDelta slid down the wall as the goblins panicked as the orb crackled with another scream.\r\n\r\nShe numbly opened the construct list.\r\n\r\n    Construction:\r\n\r\n        Corridor (50 ft): 10 mana\r\n        Room (10L x 15W): 20 mana\r\n\r\nWas this being handicapped? Was she being taunted with some unwinnable fate?\r\n\r\nDelta stood and the orb stopped crackling.\r\n\r\nThe demon-child had made a mistake, Delta used this thought to rise up off the wall and walked forward.\r\n\r\nHe had put the girl that made a habit of taking terrible monster ranches, dying villages, space stations that had rust on them, and ruined kingdoms that were built upon Cthulhu land and leading to success.\r\n\r\nDelta knew one thing and one thing only.\r\n\r\nWhen there were terms such as a cost and regeneration of that said cost over time.\r\n\r\nThen there were ways to utterly break the system.\r\n\r\nDelta walked towards the entrance to her tunnel.\r\n\r\n“Challenge accepted, ya little dick!” she shouted to the heavens and to the hells.\r\n\r\nWhere ever that demon-child was, she would find him and feed him to Delta’s dungeon floor. The meal was going to be wonderful.\r\n');

('The Bitter Truth', 'Mother of Learning', 3, 'If someone had asked Zorian at the end of the first week what classes he thought he would have the most trouble with, he would have answered Spell Formulas and Advanced Mathematics. Combat magic maybe. Two weeks later, he could safely say the answer was ‘Warding’.\r\n\r\nWarding, the art of protecting things with magic, was a surprisingly complex field. You had to take into account what the thing you’re trying to protect is made of, what its dimensions and geometry were, how the ward is going to react with the already existing magic… or you could just slap a general-purpose warding invocation on your target and hope for the best. But the professor would fail you for that answer, so that wasn’t an option in the classroom.\r\n\r\nBut these complexities aside, the class should have been a breeze, or at least not this confusing – Zorian was a patient, methodical person when it came to magecraft, and had slogged through worse offenders than warding with decent results. The problem was that their teacher, a stern woman with hair cut so short she might as well have gone all the way and shaved her head completely, didn’t know how to teach. At all. Oh, she clearly knew the subject matter very well, but she simply didn’t know how to translate that knowledge into a proper lecture. She was leaving a lot of things out of her lectures, apparently not realizing that just because they were obvious to her, they were not obvious to her students. The textbook she assigned for the class wasn’t much better, and read more like a manual for a professional warder than a student’s textbook.\r\n\r\nQuestion 6: You are tasked with building a research outpost on a first degree mana well in the Sarokian Highlands. The building is meant to support a staff of 4 at any particular time, and the prospectors have expressed concerns over heavy presence of winter wolf packs and an infestation of borer wasps in the surrounding area. You have a budget of 25.000 pieces and are assumed to be a certified second circle warder.\r\n\r\nAssuming only mana extracted from mana well is available for powering the wards, which combination of wards do you feel would be the best choice for the outpost? Explain your reasoning.\r\n\r\nDraw basic floor-plans of the planned outpost and explain how the planned room placement and shape of the building itself affect ward effectiveness.\r\n\r\nDo you think the issue of the borer wasp infestation is best resolved by using a vermin repellant ward or by careful choice of building materials? Explain your reasoning.\r\n\r\nAssume that you are commissioned to build not one but five outposts. The budget remains the same. How does this change your answer? Do you believe it is better to make the wards identical for all five outposts or do you feel some amount of difference between them is in order? Explain the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.\r\n\r\nZorian rubbed his eyes in frustration. How was he supposed to answer a question like this? He didn’t take the architecture elective, and wasn’t aware that you had to take it to do well in your warding class. Not to mention that the question assumed they knew what the market rates were for buying the necessary materials, or that they knew where the Sarokian Highlands were. Zorian was quite good at geography, and he had no idea, though considering the presence of monsters like winter wolves, he suspected they were somewhere in the northern forest.\r\n\r\nAt the very least he knew how to answer the third part of the question. The correct answer was definitely wards. Even if the outpost was made inedible to borer wasp larvae, it would still make a prime place to build a nest. Considering how territorial those insects were, you didn’t want them living anywhere near you. Theoretically, the ‘careful choice of materials’ options would free up mana that would otherwise be spent on maintaining vermin repellant wards, but those wards required very little mana flow to stay active. Especially if they were keyed specifically to borer wasps.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a girlish giggle coming from the back of the classroom. Zorian didn’t even have to turn around to know what was happening – Zach was entertaining the students around him again. He wished the teacher would penalize the guy for the disruption he was causing, especially in the middle of an exam, but Zach was a bit of a darling to the stern woman because he was the only student acing her exams. No doubt the guy had already finished his test with 100% accuracy. Which, by the way, made no sense whatsoever – during their first two years, Zach was a below-average student more distinguished because of his charm than magical talent. Kind of like a nicer version of Fortov, actually. This year, though, he was acing everything. Everything. He had a wealth of knowledge and a work ethic he hadn’t had at the end of their second year, far in excess of what could be gained through the normal passage of time.\r\n\r\nHow does one get so much better in the span of a single summer?\r\n\r\n15 minutes later he threw his pencil down on the table, calling it quits. He only filled in eight out of ten questions, and he wasn’t sure how correct these eight were, but it would have to do. He would have to set aside a couple of days for warding self-study, because the lectures were making less and less sense with every passing day. The only other student that stayed in the classroom as long as he did was Akoja, and she handed in her paper only a few seconds after he did and followed him outside. Of course, they stayed in the classroom so long for very different reasons. He stayed so he could scrape in a few stray points. She stayed because she was a perfectionist who wanted to triple check everything to make sure she didn’t forget anything.\r\n\r\n“Zorian, wait!”\r\n\r\nZorian slowed down and allowed Akoja to catch up to him. The girl could be insufferable sometimes, but she was a good person overall and he didn’t want to snap at her just because the test didn’t go the way he wanted.\r\n\r\n“How do you think you did back there?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Badly,” he answered, not seeing the point in lying.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, me too.”\r\n\r\nZorian rolled his eyes. His and her definition of ‘badly’ differed greatly.\r\n\r\n“Neolu finished in only half an hour,” said Akoja after a brief silence. “I bet she’ll get a perfect score again.”\r\n\r\n“Ako…” Zorian sighed.\r\n\r\n“I know everyone thinks I’m jealous but that’s not normal!” said Akoja in a hushed but agitated voice. “I’m pretty smart and I study all the time and I’m still having problems with the curriculum. And we’ve both been in the same class as Neolu for the past two years and she was never this good. And… and now she’s beating me in every single class!”\r\n\r\n“Kind of like Zach,” said Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Exactly like Zach!” she agreed. “They even hang out together, two of them and one other girl I don’t know, behaving like… like they’re in their own private little world.”\r\n\r\n“Or like they’re a couple,” said Zorian, before frowning. “Triple? What’s the word for a romantic relationship between 3 people?”\r\n\r\nAkoja scoffed. “Whatever. The point is the three of them do nothing but waste time together and antagonize the teachers and get perfect scores anyway. They even refused the chance to get transferred to 1st tier groups, can you believe that!?”\r\n\r\n“You’re too worked up over this,” Zorian warned.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you a little bit curious how they do it?” asked Akoja.\r\n\r\n“Of course I am,” scoffed Zorian. “It’s hard not to be. But what can I do about it? Besides, Zach has never done anything to me. I don’t want to cause problems for him just because he has suddenly discovered his inner prodigy.”\r\n\r\nZorian felt Benisek join them suddenly, simply popping up from behind a corner so he could walk beside them. Sometimes Zorian wondered if the chubby boy could smell gossip.\r\n\r\n“I know what you mean,” Benisek said. “I always thought Zach was no good at anything. You know, like me?”\r\n\r\n“Hah. Well there’s no way he got this good at everything over one summer break,” Zorian said. “I guess he was pulling the wool over our eyes all this time.”\r\n\r\n“Man, that’s so stupid,” said Benisek. “If I were that good I’d make sure everyone knew it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think he was faking lack of skill for two years straight,” Akoja huffed. “He would have slipped at least occasionally.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what’s left then?” Zorian asked. He refrained from listing some of the more obscure ways such a rapid growth could be accomplished with magic, because most of them were criminal and he was sure the academy checked Zach to make sure he wasn’t a shapeshifting imposter or possessed by the ghost of a long-dead mage.\r\n\r\n“Maybe he knows the answers in advance,” she suggested.\r\n\r\n“Only if he’s an oracle,” Benisek said. “Boole gave him an oral exam last Tuesday when you went home early, and he was rattling off answers like he swallowed the textbook.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation died down as all three filed into the alchemy classroom, which was really more of a big alchemy workshop than a typical classroom. There were about 20 tables, each one full of various containers and other equipment. All ingredients for the day’s lesson were already set out in front of them, though some would require additional preparation before they could be used in whatever process they were learning about that day – he was pretty sure they weren’t going to be putting live cave crickets into the boiling solution, for instance.\r\n\r\nAlchemy, like warding, was a complicated art, but their alchemy teacher knew her stuff and knew how to teach, so Zorian wasn’t having any issues with the class. Technically they had to work in groups of 2 or 3 students because there were not enough tables and equipment, but Zorian always paired up with Benisek which translated to working alone in practice. The only problem was getting Benisek to shut up and stop distracting him during class.\r\n\r\n“Hey Zorian,” Benisek whispered to him not so quietly. “I never noticed it until now, but our teacher is kind of hot!”\r\n\r\nZorian gritted his teeth. The blasted idiot couldn’t keep his voice down if his life was on the line. There was no way she didn’t hear that.\r\n\r\n“Benisek,” he whispered back to his partner. “I need good grades in alchemy to get my dream job when I graduate. If you screw this up for me I will never speak to you again.”\r\n\r\nBenisek grumbled mutinously before returning to his ogling. Zorian refocused on grinding the borer wasp husks into a fine powder needed for the particular type of glue they were supposed to be making.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, Azlyn Marivoski did look surprisingly good for a 50-year-old woman. Some kind of cosmetic treatment probably – she was their alchemy teacher, after all. Maybe even a true youth potion, though those were really rare and usually imperfect in some way.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why you like this class so much,” grumbled Benisek. “I’m not even sure I’d call it magical. You don’t need mana for it. It’s all searching for herbs this, cutting the roots the right way that… it’s like cooking. Hell, we’re making glue, of all things. You should leave that to girls.”\r\n\r\n“Benisek…”\r\n\r\n“It’s true!” he protested. “Even our teacher is a girl. A hot girl, but still. I read somewhere that alchemy traces its roots back to witches’ covens, with their potions and what not. Even now the best alchemical families are descended from witches. I bet you didn’t know that, huh?”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, he did know that. He was, after all, tutored in alchemy by an honest-to-gods traditional witch before he went to the academy. She was so traditional, in fact, that she scoffed at the name ‘alchemy’ and referred to her skill strictly as ‘potion making’.\r\n\r\nBut that wasn’t the sort of stuff you wanted people to know, for a wide variety of reasons.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t shut up right now I won’t let you partner with me anymore,” Zorian told him seriously.\r\n\r\n“Hey!” protested Benisek. “Who’s going to help me with that stuff, then? I’m not good at this!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Zorian innocently. “Maybe you should find some girl to help you.”\r\n\r\nFortunately, the teacher was currently too busy fawning over Zach’s newest masterpiece to pay attention to Zorian’s table – somehow the boy managed to make some kind of enhancement potion out of the provided ingredients, and that was apparently very impressive. Azlyn didn’t appear to mind that Zach completely ignored the assignment to make magical glue and did his own thing.\r\n\r\nZorian shook his head and tried to concentrate on his own work. He wondered whether he would have gotten the same reaction if he did something like that, or if he would be accused of showing off. The few times Zorian tried to wow the teachers he was simply told to work on his basics and not to get cocky, because arrogance kills. Was it because Zach was the heir of Noble House Noveda? Or something else?\r\n\r\nIt was in moments like these that he understood exactly how Akoja felt about all this.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\n“And that concludes today’s lesson,” said Ilsa. “Before you leave, however, I have an announcement to make. As some of you know, the Academy traditionally organizes a dance on the eve of the summer festival. This year is no exception. The dance will take place in the entrance hall next Saturday. For those of you who are unaware, attendance is mandatory this year.”\r\n\r\nZorian groaned, slamming his forehead into the table in front of him, causing the rest of the class to snicker. Ilsa pointedly ignored his reaction.\r\n\r\n“For those of you who don’t know how to dance, dance lessons will be held every day at eight in the evening in room six. Those of you who do know how to dance still have to come to at least one of these lessons to prove so – I will not have you embarrass me on the night of the dance. Dismissed. Miss Stroze, mister Kazinski, stay after class please.”\r\n\r\n“Oh great,” Zorian mumbled. He probably should have restrained himself from reacting so strongly to the pronouncement. Truthfully, he intended to skip the dance, regardless of how mandatory it was. Did Ilsa realize that? No, he could detect no disapproval in posture, and he was pretty sure she’d be rather annoyed if she sensed his plans.\r\n\r\n“Now then…” Ilsa began when he and Akoja were the only students left. “I assume you both know how to dance?”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” said Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Umm…” Akoja fidgeted. “I’m not very good at it.”\r\n\r\n“No matter,” Ilsa said. “We’ll iron out any gaps you may have easily enough. The reason I told you to stay behind is that I want you to help me with the dance lessons.”\r\n\r\nZorian considered refusing outright – it wasn’t something he wanted to spend his time on – but he figured this could be a favor that would make Ilsa forgive him a transgression or two. Like, say, not showing up to the mandatory dance? Before he could express his tentative agreement, however, Akoja decided in his place.\r\n\r\n“How can we help?” she said, clearly pleased they were chosen for this ‘honor’. Zorian raised an eyebrow at the way she presumed to speak for him, but let it slide for the moment.\r\n\r\n“We only have five days to teach everyone how to dance,” Ilsa said. “That’s why we’re going to use magic to help.”\r\n\r\n“Animation spells,” Zorian guessed.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Ilsa said, then quickly moved to explain for Akoja’s benefit. “There is a spell that will guide a person’s limbs and body through whatever dance it is designed for. It’s not really suitable as a substitute for dancing skill, but if you practice dancing while you’re under its effects, you will learn a lot faster than you would otherwise.”\r\n\r\n“How does that work?” Akoja asked curiously.\r\n\r\n“The spell moves you around like a puppet on a string until you learn how to move along with it, if only to make the feeling of something jerking you around go away,” said Zorian. “Eventually you no longer need the spell to dance correctly.”\r\n\r\n“I see you have personal experience with this method,” Ilsa said with a smile.\r\n\r\nZorian resisted the urge to scowl. Getting put under that spell by Daimen was one of his childhood traumas. It wasn’t amusing at all.\r\n\r\n“I sincerely hope you intend to give students a choice to refuse,“ Zorian said.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” Ilsa agreed. “Though, those who refuse this method will have to attend at least three sessions instead of one, so I expect most will choose this option instead of the traditional one. In any case, I want you two to help me cast the spell on people during the lessons. I expect I’ll have to dispel and recast the spell often, and I could use some help.”\r\n\r\n“And why did you choose us, specifically?” Zorian asked.\r\n\r\n“You both have decent control over your magic and you seem responsible enough to be taught such a spell. Animation spells targeting people are restricted material, after all, and not something normally available to students.”\r\n\r\nHuh. So how did Daimen get a hold of it then? In his second year, no less?\r\n\r\nWell, whatever. At least knowing how to cast the spell will make it easier to counter it in the future.\r\n\r\n“Anything else?” Ilsa asked. “Very well, then. Come to my office after the last class and I’ll set up some dummies for you to practice on before moving on to people. Poorly controlled, the spell is intensely uncomfortable. We don’t want to give anyone traumas.”\r\n\r\nZorian narrowed his eyes. He didn’t. Not even Daimen would… oh, who is he kidding? Of course he would have. Practicing such a spell on your own little brother was right up Daimen’s alley.\r\n\r\n“Miss Stroze, you can leave – I have something else to discuss with mister Kazinski.”\r\n\r\nIlsa began to speak the moment Akoja was gone, catching Zorian somewhat by surprise. He shook his head to clear his thoughts, trying to ignore his annoyance with Daimen in favor of paying attention to what Ilsa was saying.\r\n\r\n“So Zorian,” she said with a faint smile. “How are you getting along with your mentor?”\r\n\r\n“He’s having me work on my basic three,” Zorian told her flatly. “We’re still on the levitation exercise.”\r\n\r\nYes, even after 4 weeks, Xvim was still making him levitate a pencil over and over again. Start over. Start over. Start over. The only thing Zorian learned in those sessions was how to dodge marbles that Xvim kept throwing at him. The jerk seemed to have an endless supply of those things.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Professor Xvim likes his students to have a firm grasp of the basics before moving on to advanced topics,” Ilsa agreed.\r\n\r\nThat or he hates his students. Zorian personally thought his theory was a lot more plausible.\r\n\r\n“Well, I just wanted to tell you that you might be able to change mentors soon,” Ilsa said. “One of my students will be dropping out after the summer festival, and I’ll have a vacancy to fill. Unless something comes up, you’re almost certain to be the one I pick. That is, if you’re actually interested in a transfer.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I’m interested!” Zorian half-shouted, much to Ilsa’s amusement. He frowned for a moment. “Unless you also plan to throw marbles at me? Is that some kind of standard training method?”\r\n\r\n“No,” Ilsa chuckled. “Xvim is special that way. Well, I just wanted to see how you feel about this before doing anything. Have a nice day.”\r\n\r\nIt was only after he was out of the classroom that he realized this development greatly complicated his plan to skip out on the dance. He couldn’t afford to annoy his (potential) new mentor too much, else he’d be stuck with Xvim for the rest of his education.\r\n\r\nWell played, professor. Well played.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\n“Why can’t we just cast that spell ourselves once the dancing starts?”\r\n\r\nZorian let out a long-suffering sigh. “You can’t make an animation spell do something you don’t know how to do yourself. You don’t know how to dance, hence you cannot animate anyone to dance either. Also, how are you going to break the spell once the dance ends if you can’t move your arms where you want them to be? This really isn’t the sort of spell you should be casting on yourself.”\r\n\r\nReally, there were so many problems with that idea that Zorian struggled to put them all into words. Are these people thinking about the questions they’re asking at all?\r\n\r\n“So how many dances do we have to learn?”\r\n\r\n“Ten,” said Zorian, bracing himself for the cries of outrage.\r\n\r\nSure enough, a rumble of complaints erupted after that statement. Thankfully, Ilsa took over the lesson at this point, instructing everyone to pair up and scatter throughout the spacious room to give everyone enough space. Zorian could already feel a headache coming and cursed himself from letting Ilsa talk him into this. Even though room six was fairly spacious, there were a lot of people and the invisible pressure they gave off was particularly strong today.\r\n\r\n“You alright?” Benisek asked, putting his hand on Zorian’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I’m fine,” Zorian said, waving his hand off. He didn’t like to be touched much. “I just have a slight headache. Did you need help with something?”\r\n\r\n“Nah, you just looked like you could use some company, standing all alone in your little corner,” Benisek said. Zorian decided not to tell him that he was intentionally standing on the sidelines unless he was needed. Benisek wasn’t the sort of person who understood the need for some breathing room. “Say, who is your date for the dance anyway?”\r\n\r\nZorian suppressed a groan. Of course Benisek would want to talk about that.\r\n\r\nRelationships weren’t something Zorian thought about often. The chances that one of his classmates would agree to date him were miniscule. For one, such a relationship would quickly be noticed by the rest of their classmates, and the resulting merciless teasing was something few relationships could survive for any appreciable length. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, all teenage girls liked older guys. Dating a guy that was two or three years her senior seemed to be a status symbol for a girl, and a majority of them loudly disparaged the male population their own age as crass and immature. When they were in their first year, all the girls wanted to date third years. Now that they were in their third year, all the girls wanted to date apprenticed graduates. Since there were plenty of guys willing to play along, the chances that some girl in his class would give him the time of day was negligible.\r\n\r\nAnd the girls that weren’t his classmates? To most of them he wasn’t Zorian Kazinski, but ‘that guy who is a brother of Daimen and Fortov Kazinski’. They had this image of what he ought to be like, and once it became obvious that the real him didn’t match their expectations, they inevitably became upset.\r\n\r\nBesides, all this romantic stuff... well.\r\n\r\n“Well?” Benisek prodded.\r\n\r\n“I’m not going,” Zorian said.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean ‘I’m not going’?” Benisek said cautiously.\r\n\r\n“Just what I said,” Zorian said. “I’m skipping out on the whole dance thing. Turns out I had an alchemy-related accident and had to stay in my room for the evening.”\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps a bit cliché, but whatever. Zorian had already found a particularly tricky potion that was supposed to make a person more outgoing and sociable – something that was entirely plausible for him to try to make – that would make a person very ill when done wrong but wouldn’t actually kill him. If he does it right it will seem like an honest mistake instead of a way to weasel out of the dance.\r\n\r\n“Oh come on!” protested Benisek, and Zorian had to pinch him to make him lower his voice. The last he needed was to have Ilsa overhear him. “It’s the summer festival! A special summer festival, with the whole… parallel… thingy…”\r\n\r\n“Planar alignment,” Zorian offered.\r\n\r\n“Whatever. The point is that you have to be there. Everyone who is anyone is coming!”\r\n\r\n“I’m a nobody.”\r\n\r\nBenisek sighed. “No, Zorian, you’re not. Look, Zorian, we’re both merchant kids, right?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like where this is going,” Zorian warned.\r\n\r\nBenisek ignored him. “I know you don’t like to hear this but-“\r\n\r\n“Don’t. Just don’t.”\r\n\r\n“-you have a duty to your family to put on a good face. Your behavior reflects on them, you know.“\r\n\r\n“There is nothing wrong with my behavior,” snapped Zorian, aware that he was attracting stares of nearby people but not caring at the moment. “You’re free to go to whatever you want, but leave me out of it. I’m a nobody. A third son of a minor merchant family from the middle of nowhere. People here don’t give a fuck about me. They don’t even know who I am. And I like it that way.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, okay!” protested Benisek, gesturing wildly. “Dude, you’re making a scene…”\r\n\r\n“Whatever,” scoffed Zorian. “Leave me alone and go away.”\r\n\r\nThe nerve! If there was anyone who should take a look at the impression he was leaving to people it should be Benisek! The irresponsible leech would have been dumped into a tier three group if it wasn’t for Zorian’s constant help, and this is how he repays him? Why was he even hanging out with that guy?\r\n\r\nHe scoffed, trying to calm down. Stupid summer festival and stupid dance. The funny thing is that unlike most people who hate these kinds of events, Zorian wasn’t strictly bad at them. He knew how to dance, he knew how to eat without embarrassing himself, and he knew how to talk to people at these kinds of events. He had to know these things, because his parents used to drag him along with them when attending these kinds of events, and they made sure he knew how to behave himself properly once there.\r\n\r\nBut he hated it. He had no words to describe how much events such as these sickened him. Why should he be forced to attend something he hates when the academy had absolutely no right to demand it of him?\r\n\r\nNo, they had no right at all.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nHesitantly, Zorian knocked on the door to Ilsa’s office, wondering why she called him here. There is no way…\r\n\r\n“Come in.”\r\n\r\nZorian peeked inside and was promptly told to have a seat while Ilsa calmly sat behind her desk, drinking something out of a cup. Probably tea. She looked calm and serene but Zorian could detect an undercurrent of disapproval in her posture. Hmm…\r\n\r\n“So, Zorian,” Ilsa began. “You’ve been doing quite well in my class.”\r\n\r\n“Err, thank you, professor,” said Zorian cautiously. “I try.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, one could say you’re one of the best students in your group. A student I intend to take under my wing after this whole festival rush dies down. An example to everyone, and just as much a representative of your class as miss Stroze.”\r\n\r\nOh, this is bad.\r\n\r\n“I don’t-“\r\n\r\n“So, excited about the dance this Saturday?” asked Ilsa, seemingly changing the topic.\r\n\r\n“Yes I am,” Zorian lied smoothly. “It sounds like lots of fun.”\r\n\r\n“That’s good,” Ilsa said happily. “Because I heard that you plan to boycott the event. It was rather upsetting, I must say. I was rather clear that attendance is mandatory, I believe.”\r\n\r\nNote to self: find something horrible to do to Benisek. A spell that causes the target’s tongue to feel like it’s on fire or something… or maybe piercing pain in the genital region…\r\n\r\n“Just a bunch of nasty rumors, professor,” Zorian said smoothly. “I would never dream of intentionally boycotting the dance. If I am unable to attend-“\r\n\r\n“Zorian,” Ilsa cut him off.\r\n\r\n“Professor, why is it so important that I show up there, anyway?” asked Zorian, a bit of crankiness seeping into his voice. He knew it was a bad idea to blow up on a teacher, but damn this whole thing was pissing him off! “I have a medical condition, you know? Crowds give me headaches.”\r\n\r\nShe snorted. “They give me headaches too, if it makes you feel any better. I can give you a potion for that. The fact is I’m one of the organizers of the dance, and if too many students are absent I’ll end up with a black mark on my record. Especially if someone as prominent as yourself were to not show up.”\r\n\r\n“Me? Prominent!? I’m just an average student!” Zorian protested.\r\n\r\n“Not nearly as average as you think,” Ilsa said. “Just getting this far requires extraordinary intelligence and dedication – especially for a civilian-born student like yourself, who wasn\'t exposed to magic your entire life. People keep an eye out for people like you. Also, you’re Daimen’s younger brother, and we both know how famous he is.”\r\n\r\nZorian’s lips stretched into a thin line. Zorian was sure the last reason was what it all came down to in the end, and all the other arguments were just excuses and attempts to butter him up. Even with his brother on a whole different continent, Zorian still couldn’t escape from his shadow.\r\n\r\n“You don’t like to be compared to him,” she guessed.\r\n\r\n“No,” Zorian admitted in a clipped tone.\r\n\r\n“Why is that?” she asked curiously.\r\n\r\nZorian considered side-stepping the question – his family was a sore subject for him – but uncharacteristically decided to go for honesty. He knew it wouldn’t do much, but he felt like venting at the moment.\r\n\r\n“Everything I do is always compared to Daimen and, to a slightly lesser extent, Fortov. It has been that way since I was a child, before Daimen ever became famous. My parents have never been shy about playing favorites, and since they were always interested chiefly in social achievements, I was always found wanting. My family has no use for a withdrawn bookworm, and made that abundantly clear over the years. Until recently, they ignored me completely, treating me more like I was my sister’s babysitter than their son.”\r\n\r\n“But something happened recently that caused them to take notice of you?” Ilsa surmised.\r\n\r\n“Fortov happened,” Zorian growled out. “He bombed several exams, had to be bailed out by father’s connections. He has shown himself to be generally unreliable, which is a problem, because he was supposed to be the spare heir for the family business, just in case Daimen dies on one of his escapades. So now I am suddenly taken out of the metaphorical closet so they can groom me for the role.\'\'\r\n\r\n“But you don\'t want to be the spare?” she guessed.\r\n\r\n“I don\'t want to be involved in Kazinski family politics, period. I am not a part of that family anyway. Never was. At best, I was only ever a loosely aligned associate. I appreciate them feeding me and funding my education, and I\'m willing to reimburse them for that when I get a job, but they have no right to ask something like that of me. I won\'t hear it. I have my own life and my own plans, none of which involve playing second fiddle to my older brother and wasting time on insipid social events where people suck up to each other non-stop.”\r\n\r\nHe decided to stop there, because he was just making himself angrier. Plus, he suspected Ilsa didn’t empathize with him much. Most people thought he was simply being overdramatic about his family. They weren’t the ones who had to live with them.\r\n\r\nWhen she realized he wasn’t going to say anything more, Ilsa leaned back and took a deep breath. “I empathize with you, Zorian, but I’m afraid such comparisons are unavoidable. For what it’s worth, I think you’re shaping up to be a fine mage yourself. Not everyone can be a prodigy like Daimen.”\r\n\r\n“Right,” said Zorian, refusing to look at her.\r\n\r\nShe sighed, running her hand through her hair. “You make me feel like the villain here. Family issues aside, why are you so bothered by this? It’s a party. I thought all teenagers liked parties. Are you concerned about finding a date? Just ask some first-years and they’ll jump at the chance – they can’t attend unless invited by an upperclassman, you know?”\r\n\r\nZorian released a sigh of his own. He wasn’t looking for a way to find a date – he had no doubt that simply dropping his last name would net him some impressionable giggly first year for the evening – he was looking for a way out. Something that Ilsa wasn’t willing to provide him with, it seemed.\r\n\r\n“I’m not getting a date,” Zorian told her, rising from his seat. “I may have to come to the dance, but I’m pretty sure that bringing a date is not mandatory. Have a nice day.”\r\n\r\nHe was surprised that Ilsa didn’t try to contradict him as he left. Maybe this whole dance thing won’t be such a chore.\r\n\r\n- break -\r\n\r\nZorian trudged through the corridors of his residence building wearily, not in any real hurry to get to his room. The teachers had refrained from giving them any substantial homework over the weekend, knowing that everyone would be too preoccupied with the summer festival to get any work done. Normally all that free time would be a godsend to Zorian, but just thinking about what he would have to endure tomorrow was enough to make Zorian lose the will to do anything fun or productive, so he fully intended to go to sleep the moment he arrived at his room.\r\n\r\nAs he entered his residence building he noted that someone was already in a celebratory mood, because the walls of the corridor he was passing through were full of colorful splotches in vivid yellow, green, and red.\r\n\r\n“Zorian! Just the man I was looking for!”\r\n\r\nZorian jerked in shock at the loud voice behind him and whirled around to face the man who invaded his personal space. He scowled at the grinning idiot in front of him.\r\n\r\n“Why are you here, Fortov?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“What, I can’t visit my little brother?” he protested. “You too good to hang out with big bro?”\r\n\r\n“Cut the crap, Fortov. You never come to me when you just want to hang out with someone. What do you need help with, now?”\r\n\r\n“That’s totally not true,” he huffed. “You’re my favorite brother, you know?”\r\n\r\nZorian stared at him impassively for a few seconds. “Daimen isn’t here so you’ll settle for me, huh?”\r\n\r\n“Daimen is an asshole,” Fortov snapped. “Ever since he got famous he’s always too busy to help out his younger brother. I swear, that guy only thinks about himself.”\r\n\r\n“The hypocrisy is thick with this one,” Zorian mumbled.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, I didn’t catch that,” Fortov said.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing,” Zorian waved dismissively. “So what kind of trouble are you in now?”\r\n\r\n“Um, I might have promised a friend I’ll make her an anti-rash potion,” Fortov said sheepishly.\r\n\r\n“There is no such thing as an anti-rash potion,” huffed Zorian. “There is, however, an anti-rash salve, which is applied directly to the affected skin instead of being imbibed like a potion is. This just shows what a total dunderhead you are when it comes to alchemy. What the hell were you thinking, promising your friend something like that?”\r\n\r\n“I kind of pushed her into a purple creeper patch during our wilderness survival class,” Fortov admitted. “Please, you have to help me! I’ll find you a girlfriend if you do!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want a girlfriend!” snapped Zorian irritably. Least of all the kind of girlfriend Fortov would set him up with. “Look, why are you bothering me about this? Just go to the apothecary and buy some.”\r\n\r\n“It’s Friday evening. All stores are closed in preparation for the celebration tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Well that’s too bad, because I can’t help you,” said Zorian. “First two years are all theory and lab safety, and I’m just starting my third year. We haven’t done any serious alchemy in class so far.”\r\n\r\nSo true and yet such a bald-faced lie. He hadn’t done all that much alchemy in class but he had done quite a bit of private study in his free time. He could make an antidote for the purple creeper rash easily, but why should he spend his expensive alchemical ingredients?\r\n\r\n“Oh man, come on. You can speak three different languages and you know all the silly shaping exercises they make us learn, but you can\'t even do something so basic? What the hell are you doing in your room all day long if not learning how to do stuff like that?”\r\n\r\n“You\'re one to talk!” Zorian snapped. “You\'re a year older than me, you should be perfectly capable of doing this yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Eh, you know I never cared for alchemy. Too fiddly and boring for me,” Fortov said with a dismissive wave. “Besides, I can’t even make vegetable soup without ruining mom’s kitchenware, do you really want me around alchemical equipment?”\r\n\r\nWell, when he put it that way…\r\n\r\n“I’m tired,” Zorian said. “I’ll make it tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Are you crazy!? Tomorrow is too late!”\r\n\r\n“Oh come on, it’s not like she’ll die of a goddamn rash!” said Zorian irritably.\r\n\r\n“Please, Zorian, I know you don’t care about these kind of things but she’s crushing on this boy and-“\r\n\r\nZorian groaned and tuned him out. That’s pretty much all he needed to know about this ‘emergency’.\r\n\r\n“-and if my friend’s rash isn’t fixed by then she won’t be able to go and she’ll never forgive me! Please, please, please-“\r\n\r\n“Stop it.”\r\n\r\n“-please, please, please, please-“\r\n\r\n“I said stop it! I’ll do it, okay? I’ll make the damn salve, but you owe me big time for this, you hear?”\r\n\r\n“Yup!” he said cheerfully. “How much time do you need?”\r\n\r\n“Meet me at the fountain in about three hours,” Zorian sighed.\r\n\r\nZorian watched him as he ran away, probably so he wouldn’t change his mind or make some concrete demands. He shook his head and went back to his room to retrieve the necessary alchemical reagents. The academy had an alchemical workshop students could use for their own projects, but you had to bring your own ingredients. Fortunately, he had everything he needed for this particular task.\r\n\r\nThe workshop was totally empty aside from him, but that wasn’t very unusual. Most people were preparing for the dance tomorrow and were unlikely to do some last-minute alchemy practice. Unfazed by the eerie silence of the workshop, Zorian scattered the reagents across the table and set to work.\r\n\r\nIronically, the main ingredient of the anti-rash salve was the very plant that was the cause of this mess – the purple creeper, or more accurately its leaves. Zorian had already left them to dry in the sun, and now they only had to be ground to powder. This was generally the most annoying part of the procedure, as purple creeper leaves released a cloud of irritating dust into the air if they were simply crushed with a standard mortar and pestle set. The textbooks he read had all sorts of fancy ways to deal with this, usually involving expensive equipment, but Zorian had a much simpler solution: he wrapped the leaves in a slightly wet piece of cloth, then wrapped the whole thing in a piece of leather, and then hammered the resulting lump until he felt no resistance. The irritating dust would bond with the cloth and the leaf pieces wouldn’t.\r\n\r\nAfter mixing the leaf dust with 10 drops of honey and a spoon of oblia berry juice, he put the whole thing over a low fire, stirring the contents until they achieved uniform color and consistency. Then he removed the bowl from the fire and sat down while he waited for the stuff to cool.\r\n\r\n“That was very impressive work,” a rather feminine voice sounded behind him. “Nice improvisation with the creeper leaves. I’ll have to remember that trick.”\r\n\r\nZorian recognized the owner of the voice though, and Kael wasn’t really female, despite some nasty rumors. He turned around to face the morlock boy, studying his bone white hair and intense blue eyes for a moment before returning his attention to cleaning the alchemical equipment he had used. No reason to get barred from using the workshop because he failed to clean up after himself.\r\n\r\nHe struggled to formulate a response while Kael was inspecting the salve with a practiced eye. The boy was rather mysterious, having only joined their group this year by transferring from gods know where, and not being very talkative. Plus, you know, he was a morlock. How long had the boy been watching him? Sadly, he had a tendency to lose track of his surroundings when he worked on something so he couldn’t tell.\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing special,” Zorian finally said. “Now your work… that’s impressive. I get the notion that you’re on a whole different level from the rest of us when it comes to alchemy. Even Zach can’t beat you most of the time, and he seems to be acing everything these days.”\r\n\r\nThe white-haired boy smiled mildly. “Zach doesn’t have the passion for the subject. Alchemy requires a craftsman’s touch and a lot of patience, and no matter how extensive his knowledge is, Zach just doesn’t have the mentality for it. You do. If you had as much practice with alchemy as Zach apparently does, you’d surpass him for sure.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, so you think he has prior experience, too?” Zorian inquired.\r\n\r\n“I do not know him as well as yourself and the rest of your peers, having only recently joined your group. Still, one does not get as proficient in this field as Zach apparently is in a matter of months. He works with the practiced ease of someone who has been doing alchemy for years.”\r\n\r\n“Like you,” tried Zorian.\r\n\r\n“Like me,” Kael confirmed. “I hate to be rude, but are you finished here? I’d like to make something myself today.”\r\n\r\nZorian apologized to the boy for the hold-up, which the morlock waved off as something of little importance, and bid him goodbye.\r\n\r\nAs he walked away, it occurred to Zorian that he should have probably made some kind of sleeping potion for himself while he was at it – he had to get plenty of rest tonight, because he certainly wouldn’t get any tomorrow.');

('The Capped Limit', 'There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.', 6, '\r\n\r\nBoss rooms were amazing.\r\n\r\nDelta paced the hallway between her core and Fran’s room.\r\n\r\nNot only did the new room push hew max mana to 30, it also increased her regen to 2 a day! It hadn’t even been a full day since Delta had awoken. It had almost been…\r\n\r\nDelta didn’t know. There was no time here besides moving Mushys about which took 10 minutes exactly, even if it was only a single meter away. Until her Mana rose up of its own accord, then she had had a decent idea.\r\n\r\nDid dungeon cores expire? Did time affect her slower or as long as she was in her dungeon… was she safe? Immortal from age? Delta felt a little cold at the idea of being trapped underground for the rest of time.\r\n\r\nAt least she wasn’t alone.\r\n\r\nShe had her Mushys, her gobs and Fran.\r\n\r\nEverything a sane mind needed to last more than 24 hours.\r\n\r\nSpeaking off, the goblins had returned. Shooting a dirty look at the single mushroom growing on the ceiling. She would have Hob remove it, she zoomed to the entrance, flying past the snoozing Fran and his new pig, over the Goblin camp where a mushroom burned as it appeared too close to the fire.\r\n\r\nIt made Delta feel better.\r\n\r\nHob dropped more unspeakables, two branches, and a rock. Gob seemed to have been more adventurous as he brought back… a little of everything.\r\n\r\nHe dropped some dark berries, small stones and some weedy looking plants. They all began to instantly melt down into Mana. It was a shame, Delta wouldn’t mind actually keeping some things once in awhile.\r\n\r\nShe waited and before long, her menu appeared.\r\n\r\n    Rence Berries absorbed! Healthy Berry unlocked!\r\n    Clingy Petals absorbed! Decorative flower unlocked! Sticky Floor Panel cost reduced by 1 DP!\r\n\r\nDelta hummed as she read this. The petals seemed to have some annoying habit of sticking to people\'s clothes if Gob’s furs were to be an indicator. Did absorbing a ‘sticky’ material reduce the burden of buying something?\r\n\r\nSticky floor trap seemed pretty simple, an enemy stepped on it and got stuck. Delta paced as she thought it out. By taking in more and more things that had a sticky component, she cut her work in half.\r\n\r\nStill, only 1 DP was a little lacking in reductions. Delta had a feeling the DP cost was a one time deal… still wouldn’t hurt to get a bit more. The berries were like the apple, a food she could make.\r\n\r\nWas she suppose to lure people in with them… the idea that food might be in her dungeon? Eyeing her 25 mana, she hesitated and then created another goblin. It formed with a swirl, growling as it formed in the tunnel.\r\n\r\nHob and Gob looked unbothered by it and the goblin also looked rather shocked by sudden existence.\r\n\r\n“Keep this tunnel safe and watch out for the Mushys,” she added and the goblin lumbered off, going deeper. Delta thought about naming it then shrugged. There was going to be so many of these things eventually that it was going to be impossible to keep up with the demands of names.\r\n\r\nHaving a goblin between the entrance and the boss room made her dungeon feel a little more professional.\r\n\r\nWhich left her 15 mana to play with…She curiously made an apple. Just to see what it would do.\r\n\r\nThe red, glossy, fruit appeared but it seemed translucent as if not made solid yet.\r\n\r\nDelta moved it and it reminded her of the trap placement. She had fun clipping it through the wall where it buzzed in error.\r\n\r\nHob moved after not getting more orders and moved directly through her apple placement. Something happened and quickly vanished as he kept moving.\r\n\r\n“Wait!” Delta called and the gob froze. She pushed the apple into him and a whole new menu appeared. Delta blinked, caught completely off guard as this new… odder brother of her personal menu hovered before her.\r\n\r\n    Item placement:\r\n\r\n        Equip to mob (use 1)\r\n        Bind as a soul drop (Monster does not respawn)\r\n        Use on monster(Out of battle, able to use item)\r\n\r\nDrop? Equip?!\r\n\r\nDelta inhaled and looked at the apple in her ghostly hands.\r\n\r\nCould she make monsters loot drop? Er… soul drop? Delta frowned and let the goblin go with his brother to rest at the camp. They looked bushed and Delta felt a bit guilty for making them basically farm for her all day.\r\n\r\nShe focused back on the apple after making sure both gobs were comfortable after a moment around the fire. Both their grubby faces peering down the hall at Fran’s door, respectful.\r\n\r\nIt took 10 mana to summon a goblin. It took 3 mana to summon an apple. If that goblin had an apple as a soul drop, that was 13 mana down the drain for… what?\r\n\r\nCould she booby trap her monsters maybe? Put bombs in them in case they were murdered? Delta didn’t think so and opened her menu to start flicking through options. She came to the goblin summoning page and frowned. She held the apple in one hand then touched the goblin page, not hitting confirm but just poking the general area.\r\n\r\nA new box opened up.\r\n\r\n    Goblin: a weak demi-being. Uses large numbers, quick reproduction cycles and rare shaman magic to avoid being wiped out. Has many evolution paths around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was… handy. Did that work for all her little things?\r\n\r\nShe tried the apple.\r\n\r\n    Healthy Apple: a sweet apple that has the barest of healing properties due to being soaked in mana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDelta reread it and silently apologised for mocking the apple where it could hear it. A potential healing apple! Every good tactician saw the use of a thing that kept the troops fighting.\r\n\r\nLooking through her menus, Delta spotted a tiny change that escaped her noticed. On her Purchase menus for items, a tiny button existed next to both the apple and berry.\r\n\r\nDelta tried touching the one next to the apple.\r\n\r\n    Would you like to pre-set the apple to be summoned with a monster or container? Please select which monster from the summon menu or please choose a chest on the map\r\n\r\nDelta felt her blood rush as she discovered some new… side of her power.\r\n\r\nShe touched the goblin section and two more options appeared.\r\n\r\n    Equip as an item (Goblins may have 1 weapon, 1 armour, 1 consumable) Summon cost +2 mana\r\n    Bind as a soul drop(Goblins will drop this item when it disperses on a chance) Summon cost +1 Mana\r\n\r\nDelta fled back to her core room. She needed familiar ground to pace about.\r\n\r\nShe barely saw her new goblin standing outside Fran’s door, just staring. Odd thing…\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nQuiss sipped at his sweet dew flask. He would prefer something stronger. Nibs had just got a casket of Stumbling Minotaur. Quiss sighed wistfully. That stuff had given him some memorable and… not so easily remembered moments.\r\n\r\nSweet dew would work for today. It gave his work a bit a more mellow feel. Now, if he worked in a city that had more than 200 people, he’d be diligent and hard-working. But Durence was not those cities and he gave up being serious after his first year. People took care of themselves here.\r\n\r\nBeing a Peace Keeper was a thing the king required of all towns. Mobs never made anyone happy who had to clean up their messes. Sadly, the tax man still came to them. A fair amount but the rotund taxman had a second job to make sure all the king’s laws were being followed.\r\n\r\nWhich meant, that one day, Quiss had found himself taking from his budding wizard studies and dumped into the PK office. A shack that had the sword and shield symbol painted crudely on one side.\r\n\r\nNo one else had wanted to give up their lives or their hobbies to be the person who had to deal with everyone else.\r\n\r\nNeither did Quiss but he slept in at that meeting and missed his chance to push it on the deaf elder that lived down the street. Another sign he needed to quit drinking. First, it was that bad polymorph spell and now it was this Peace Keeper nonsense.\r\n\r\nQuiss rounded the corner as a woman threatened an orange snake curling around a tree. Quiss almost just turned around but the woman had her heatblade powered up. A model that was so out of date that Quiss could here the blade grumpy protesting at actually working.\r\n\r\nA heatblade was bothersome. A sword that channelled a fire crystal usually resulted in someone\'s house or livestock going up in smoke.\r\n\r\nNo one wanted a repeat of the great goat fire of four summers ago…\r\n\r\nQuiss waved one hand and the snake floated away into the grass on the other sides of the woman’s garden.\r\n\r\nOne air spell, he used it mostly to sweep the float but it worked just fine here.\r\n\r\n“Oh, such a dove,” the woman smiled as she thanked him, hiding her weapon as if Quiss would levitate her over the hedge next.\r\n\r\n“Just keeping the peace,” he said an almost automatic response these days. His voice sounded dulled and he longed for his bed.\r\n\r\nHe only did this job for three reasons.\r\n\r\nThe free drinks at night. The lack of paperwork. The third reason was he honestly was scared someone would burn his hut down if he didn’t keep confiscation charged crystals, crossbows that had been enchanted, unstable homebrewed potions, herbal mixes that should really have not been mixed.\r\n\r\nThen there were the more sane people that just hacked their own limbs off when they got a bit too drunk and fancied themselves knights of the Verluan Kingdom. Quiss didn’t know healing magics or healing potion mixtures or any herbal remedy for stupidity.\r\n\r\nBut… he did know that his old blue coat still inspired people to at least pretend to be rational.\r\n\r\nQuiss considered that to be a gamble on any given day.\r\n\r\nHe just really wanted people to run out of magic supplies for the month so he could sleep all day. Now that he thought about it… the air did seem...crisper.\r\n\r\nMana was a bother. If it was here, your life was… mostly great. If it was gone your life was mostly...not great.\r\n\r\nMana made things grow, it made people strong to illness and the cold. Nothing like actual magic but it helped. Quiss knew the fairy tails like the back his nose.\r\n\r\nNot seen it himself but definitely sure it was there.\r\n\r\nMana made magic. Magic made reality. Reality was something they all had to bloody deal with some hurrah for magic.\r\n\r\nSome old maids still believe living on Mana rich land blessed you and your brats. Quiss also knew it meant that dusty of weapons that haven’t seen light since his own grandfather went gob hunting, never really went dry of power.\r\n\r\nSo, now every Jewn, Horn, Quilla, and Nib was blasting magic out their asses like it was going out of style. Which made his job harder, which meant he had to find out why, which meant he could not sleep.\r\n\r\nQuiss hoped whatever was making mana rise was having a good laugh at his expense…\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n“Leave me alone!” Delta cried as a mushroom invaded her core room. Hob picked it up and it shrivelled up.\r\n\r\nDelta thanked him before she went back to her menu.\r\n\r\nDecorations were… well, pure pretty things. Things to make her dungeon feel less like a randomly generated dungeon with those super familiar textures and rendered hallways and more like a unique place of mushroom and weeds.\r\n\r\nShe hadn’t quite figure out how to turn it off but she was eyeing that Mushroom Grove room. She sighed while she went over what she learned.\r\n\r\nDelta could work loot drops for her monsters. This was… interesting in its applications. By binding, say an apple, to the goblin blueprint, for a lack of a better word, she would summon goblins with apples equipped or bound as soul drops. Every single goblin would get an apple.\r\n\r\nHowever, it cost more for the goblin to equip and use it against adventurers than it would be for intruders to kill her monsters and farm them. The system was biased and Delta would burn it.\r\n\r\nUntil that long away day, Delta saw that goblin and an apple was 13 mana. A goblin with an apple as a soul drop was 11, one as am equip was 12.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t mean much. 2 mana was not the end of the world. But this was a symbolic number. This was going was grow as she bound more important items to far stronger monsters.\r\n\r\nA dragon and the orb of immortality would be better combined than summoned separate, saving her a few billion mana. The system wasn’t stupid, however. Delta could not remove an item once it was bound. There was no cost scumming here.\r\n\r\nDelta could not spawn an apple goblin and take the apple away to save 2 mana. The system barred her and gave her the worst kidney punch for it.\r\n\r\nIt was all well and good but the overall question was brought back to why?\r\n\r\nWhy did she reward people for killing her monsters?\r\n\r\nThe obvious answer was, of course, to lure more. Good at killing? Make a buck collecting a dozen rusty swords in this here pit. Delta sighed.\r\n\r\nIt made sense from her point of view, the core that use be on the side of raiding dungeons. But now? As the person who really didn’t want people down here because the idea of people finding her core sent such waves of dread flowing through her it physically hurt?\r\n\r\nIt baffled her. Yes, humans gave decent mana but she already ruled out mindless murder. So, was there any point in making her place look appealing to the stabby-happy heroes?\r\n\r\nThe question gnawed at her and it was the same one that rose when she couldn’t seal off her core room.\r\n\r\nWhy did she have to let the humans have a fair chance at winning and getting rewards? What did she get out of it? Delta rose and paced. Mana and DP. Her lifeblood. It was the sole purpose she had mobs and traps. To farm these elements. Why?\r\n\r\nTo grow and to become more complex?\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nTo become famous for not being beatable or to repel of invaders?\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nTo let her legend grow and let more challengers come.\r\n\r\nWHY?\r\n\r\nBecause… what’s the point of being a dungeon if there were no people?\r\n\r\nDelta slowed to a stop.\r\n\r\nHer dungeon suddenly seemed… very quiet. It felt… suffocating.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to kill people,” she whispered, the walls that just made her feel safe now made her feel entombed.\r\n\r\n“Boss?” a voice called, deeper and more powerful than the rest.\r\n\r\nIt took only a second but Delta was in the boss room. The rounded room looked polished but Delta wondered if it would slowly chip away once people flooded in.\r\n\r\n“Dungeon feels bad. Master okay?” Fran wondered and Delta sighed.\r\n\r\n“Why do we want mens in the dungeon?” she asked, not sure what to expect from Fran. The pig sniffed and oinked in his sleep. Fran was busy jabbing with his spear but stopped. The goblin looked at her.\r\n\r\n“For power. To grow into a legendary dungeon!” he said with excitement and Delta frowned.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t want to kill them, the mens I mean,” she added and Fran just nodded. Delta waited and Fran stared.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean yes?!” Delta squawked. Fran jumped and his pig squealed in fright.\r\n\r\n“Master just needs to delay. Stall mens til full of power! No?” he asked, confused and Delta just stared.\r\n\r\n“Fran… are you saying I get mana from things… just being in my dungeon?” she repeated and Fran nodded with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Mens give good mana, some dungeons have inns in middle to keep mana coming. Hob and Gob tell me stories, they heard from shaman,” he added. Delta sat down heavily.\r\n\r\n“I don’t need to aim to kill… I just need to… make them have an adventure? Do I need to loot block them long enough to leech mana of them? I don’t have to be a murderhobo dungeon?!” Delta demanded with joy.\r\n\r\nFran just nodded slowly. Using her voice, he seemed to he a good idea where she was, the other mobs just looked up. Delta wanted to hug the little green deadly pig rider.\r\n\r\nShe then noticed something about the room.\r\n\r\n“Fran… why is there no mushrooms in here?” she asked lightly and Fran looked at his pig who snored lightly.\r\n\r\n“Bacon see them and gets hungry,” he shrugged.\r\n\r\nDelta loved Bacon.\r\n'),
('The Human Touch', 'There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.', 5, 'Boss rooms are trials.\r\n\r\nDelta paced as she waited for Hob and Gob to return with more… of those wretched things.\r\n\r\nMana was already an issue on large spending, Delta couldn’t afford to just turn down a free source of income. Especially when it came with free DP.\r\n\r\nShe just wished they would find something else. Anything else…\r\n\r\nSo, as she waited, Delta pondered the boss room.\r\n\r\nHaving one meant her core had a final layer of protection before someone reached her core, that was good!\r\n\r\nShe’d need to evolve Fran into something else with a pig as a backup to form something she may not want protecting her core. The Mushys were hard enough to look at without fleeing. Seeing one yawning… or just hissing at the air made her ghostly flesh break out in goosebumps.\r\n\r\nIt was also just the idea that having a boss room meant that Delta was… cementing her purpose as a dungeon. Fight the weak mobs, find the loot, beat the boss, level up, and go home.\r\n\r\nThe bread and butter of any good adventure.\r\n\r\nExcept… Delta didn’t have loot… or some grand treasure chest at the end.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sub-par! I’m still developing,” she assured herself and Fran’s ears flicked as if hearing but choosing not to comment as he enjoyed the new goblin camp. The little guy did look a lot more healthy in the glow of the fire.\r\n\r\nDelta summed up the life of a dungeon core. Make a dungeon, lure adventurers, kill them, grow, lure more people. Delta felt like she could maybe… with some effort cut it down to just the lure and grow stage somehow.\r\n\r\nFar be it for Delta to stop an idiot wandering in here with nothing but a pot on his head and a butter knife. Delta felt bad about luring in the unaware or lost, not the terminally stupid, that was practically doing the species as a whole a favour after all.\r\n\r\nYou don’t feel sorry for the people who set their head on fire and expect to be fine.\r\n\r\nNo, Delta wanted to have people agree to the game of dungeon and goblins. Win and get the shinies, lose and well… thanks for playing? It seemed too hopeful but if Delta could just show those that came near that her dungeon was dangerous and the unprepared should turn around and walk away, then she’d just feel better about the whole defending herself against humanity thing.\r\n\r\n“Maybe… I can?” Delta muttered and opened the menu to the construction upgrade section.\r\n\r\n    Upgrade entrance into simple entrance hall: 10 DP or 20 Mana\r\n\r\nDelta thought about it. She could purchase both the boss room and the entrance hall. Having 2 DP to spare and potentially having way more once her gobs returned.\r\n\r\nWith… more mushrooms.\r\n\r\nDelta swallowed back more gags and tried to focus.\r\n\r\nIt seemed… that making a boss monster had no actual price and that worried Delta.\r\n\r\nNothing good was free in this little new life of hers. Except for mushrooms but they could go die in a fire.\r\n\r\nOnce she got the boss room up and running. There did seem to be no extra steps needed for pushing Fran up to the next level of evolution.\r\n\r\nWith a pig involved somehow…\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was undoable? A one time, no-take-backies? Would Fran be her forever level 1 floor boss? Was that really a bad thing? Maybe down the line, when she had uber-wizards and three-headed frost wolves, it would be but for now, she had two fungi and three goblins between her and smashed-to-bits death.\r\n\r\nNecessity was the mother of bad choices.\r\n\r\nDelta purchased both rooms and the boss room flashed red and refused to be purchased. Delta blinked and saw a map opening, her two rooms flashing red. Right… need a room… to make a boss room.\r\n\r\nOne step at a time.\r\n\r\nA room cost 20 mana and she had 15 going for her. Delta glared at her tiny single mana regen.\r\n\r\nOne day, she would regen enough mana to spend as wasteful as she wanted…\r\n\r\nOh, the gobs were back, joy. She zoomed to the entrance and saw them carrying more mushrooms but… Gob had something in his other hand.\r\n\r\nHe dropped it and it landed with a thud.\r\n\r\n“Is that an apple? Gob, where did… you get an apple?” she asked and the goblin shook his hands in defence.\r\n\r\n“Tree! Climbed with teeth, belonged to no mans!” he promised. Delta watched it fade as her dungeon consumed it. It tasted sweet but Delta braced herself as the dropped more mushrooms.\r\n\r\n...Urgh.\r\n\r\nBut the apple made her mind spin.\r\n\r\nIf mushrooms gave her the mushys, and the fire crystal gave her access to some fire related items…\r\n\r\n“Gob, go bring me a few branches and rocks,” she requested. Delta thought about how her tunnels just banished whatever soil was in the way, she hadn’t seen one rock or root appear in any of them. Just hard packed soil.\r\n\r\nThe apple finished fading and her menu popped up.\r\n\r\n    Apple consumed. New menu unlocked.\r\n\r\n    Item menu:\r\n\r\n        Healthy Apple: 3 Mana\r\n\r\nDelta closed her eyes and then opened them again. Nope, she could indeed magic food out of thin frigging air!\r\n\r\n“Why?” was her first question. It was a good one, she allowed.\r\n\r\nWhy would she, a dungeon with no stomach or her monsters… who didn’t seem to needed to eat… need an apple?\r\n\r\nIt seemed a rather odd thing for her dungeon powers to have. Would she be able to plant them and turn them into some kind of apple fiend? Exploding apple traps? Goblins throwing apples?!\r\n\r\nDelta closed the box and put the thought to rest as Gob returned.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the two branches and some stones on the ground. Delta watched with interest as the items vanished.\r\n\r\nHer mana was now 22, the apple giving her a whole 2 mana compared to the single 1 of the mushrooms.\r\n\r\nWas it because they were more healthy? Or did the world hate the mushrooms as much as Delta did?\r\n\r\nHer mana shot to 32, the rocks about 2 mana each and the larger branches giving her 3 each. Not that she needed to keep track of this, Gob would be going back for more soon…\r\n\r\nDelta rubbed her ghostly hands as she quickly made another hallway shooting west from her core room and a new room to cap it off.\r\n\r\nThat quickly brought her down to 2 mana.\r\n\r\nHer menu popped open as she finished up.\r\n\r\n    Wood functions added to ‘Construction’ and ‘Trap’ menus.\r\n    Stone functions added to ‘Construction’ and ‘Trap’ menus.\r\n\r\nA quick flick through saw some changes. Her torches could be made of tiny lumps of stone on the wall instead of wooden sticks now. No cost increase since it didn’t seem to be much better quality.\r\n\r\nHowever, as she peered at the purchase menu she saw something very different.\r\n\r\n    Trap Purchase:\r\n\r\n        Sticky Floor Panel: 10 DP\r\n        Weak Tripwire: 5 DP\r\n        Falling Rock (Weak): 10 DP/ 10 Mana\r\n        Flame Gout trap: 8 DP\r\n        Stake trap: 10 DP: covered sharpened sticks designed to ruin boots and hurt feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Construction Purchase:\r\n\r\n        Upgrade entrance into simple entrance hall: 10 DP or 20 Mana\r\n        Upgrade dungeon dirt walls into wood reinforced dirt walls: 10 DP\r\n        Upgrade dungeon walls into rough rock walls. Required ‘Reinforced Dirt Walls’\r\n        Upgrade simple wooden torches into stone sconces: 10 DP/ 10 Mana\r\n        Simple wooden door: 5 DP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Items Purchase:\r\n\r\n        Moss: 5 DP\r\n\r\n\r\nDelta looked at the list and saw several options before that was DP cost only now had a mana cost as well, allowing to choose to spend mana instead of precious DP. Did supplying materials ease the burden of creation?\r\n\r\nBy choosing to gather resources instead of simply waiting for her Mana to build, did she circumvent the one time cost with mere effort? Delta wanted to giggle at the absurdity. Fran made her feel like she wasn’t the only dungeon around. Did other dungeons do this?\r\n\r\nSurely… Did they? Then again, how many had access to contracted goblins and a forest? She hummed as the Hob and Gob ran back out.\r\n\r\n“Something other than mushrooms!” she called but wasn’t sure they heard her.\r\n\r\nAh well… who knows? Maybe they’d find some burgers or some soda? A girl-turned-dungeon-core could hope.\r\n\r\nShe quickly paid the fee to move her core to the new room and felt a little tingle of excitement grow as the orb floated gently down the new tunnel.\r\n\r\nFrom 69 DP to 59 which left her plenty to play with. As she waited for the Core to fully move, Delta spent 10 DP at the entrance.\r\n\r\nIt made her giddy… almost ecstatic to see the world shift at her command. Delta liked improving, she liked growing.\r\n\r\nShe had to wonder how much of that was built into her and how much was her human mind trying to understand the sheer impossibility of her current existence.\r\n\r\nThe simple cave-like entrance bulged as it became more like a doorway, arched and high. The tunnel immediately closest to it hollowed out on either side, making a space big enough for five people to stand comfortably. The ceiling domed up a little, making the space feel open and letting a bit of a breeze float down the down.\r\n\r\nThe little chamber shuddered as two wooden beams formed on either side of the door and then across the top.\r\n\r\nDelta’s eyes glazed over as she saw from a distance, the outside of the new entrance… had a single space above the hole.\r\n\r\nIt prompted Delta to say add something… words… a warning.\r\n\r\nDelta shuddered as she focused on the words she wanted to be carved into the wood.\r\n\r\nWell… here she was world. Dungeon Core Delta.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the outside, challenging the world, the tiny hole in the ground had three words carved into the wooden plank above the entrance.\r\n\r\nIt simply claimed one time.\r\n\r\n“Here be Danger”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanking the two gobs, she sent both of them back out. They seemed to enjoy the gathering missions so Delta left them to it.\r\n\r\nBesides, she was excited to do the next project.\r\n\r\nBefore Delta left, she made two torches on either side of the little chamber, her last two mana gone.\r\n\r\nLike running water, the soil ran down-and-out before it hardened into simple wooden sticks. Then as if some deity spoke, the tips burst into a weak flame that lit the chamber up enough to just show how dark the tunnel ahead was.\r\n\r\nDelta likes them.\r\n\r\nIf the warning and the creepy darkness didn’t keep people out, then Mushy deserved some fun.\r\n\r\nSpeaking off…\r\n\r\n“Doing a great job!” she praised as the first Mushy wriggled.\r\n\r\nIt listened and then after a moment… hesitantly thanked her for the praise. It felt gruff and rather startled by having to actually talk to her.\r\n\r\n“Okay! Right,” Delta said brightly, fleeing down the tunnel before she had to force more interaction with it. Delta wondered if she could ever make cute monsters… not that she disliked Mushys or her gobs… she just wished she could have something that didn’t look like it was designed solely for ripping throats out of people.\r\n\r\nShe came to her empty room and flexed her fingers.\r\n\r\nDelta was honestly more curious than anything about what would happen. Would a door appear? Would the intruders need to find some skeleton key to gain entrance?\r\n\r\nDelta clicked purchase and watched as her DP drained and the room pulsed before it stilled.\r\n\r\nDelta blinked.\r\n\r\n“Uh… where’s my boss room?” she demanded and the map opened to cheerfully show the room now had a skull symbol on it. That meant boss room, apparently.\r\n\r\n“So… this is what I get? Nothing happened!” Delta sulked. She opened the menu to see that Fran was able to evolve due to an empty boss room.\r\n\r\nDid any rare monster have the ability to become a boss? Delta wondered what it took to make a rare in the first place? Hob and Gob were contracted, and she assumed they were somehow voided of that power…\r\n\r\nWhat about her Mushys?\r\n\r\nIf she tried to get over her mushroom gag reflexes and got on well with one of them… would that change anything?\r\n\r\nShrugging, Delta hit the evolve button.\r\n\r\nFran came zooming into the room, yelping as he was pulled by some invisible magnet.\r\n\r\n“Master! I serve!” he yelled as he landed in the middle of the room with a crash. Delta winced as he picked himself up.\r\n\r\nThen the room shuddered.\r\n\r\nIt shook once and then it didn’t stop shaking. Fran looked around with amazement as the ground under his feet glowed.\r\n\r\n“I… a boss?” he asked with a faint voice. He sniffed as the light travelled up his body.\r\n\r\n“I serve you until I dust!” he promised, and then he was swallowed by the light and the room followed suit.\r\n\r\nDelta closed her eyes as the light grew brighter. Then there was the sound of oinking and Delta blinked her eyes open.\r\n\r\nHer boring room was now far bigger than it should have been. As the dust settled and Delta could make out details, she opened her map and saw the despite the fact the room seemed to have grown about 3x its previous size, the map claimed the actual space had not budged at all.\r\n\r\n“I… broke space,” Delta choked.\r\n\r\nThe bare soil ground and walls had gone. The floor was a rough coarse dust or sand, mixing in with the soil underneath but never truly spreading too far. Then walls seemed to ripple and spread out as the room stretched, only now did Delta see that all the corners had gone.\r\n\r\nThis was some circular arena now and it even had very rough seats for lost audiences or her gobs.\r\n\r\nOn the far side, Delta saw a crack in the wall that stood out from the perfectly round room.\r\n\r\n“Fran?” she called and from the darkness came two red eyes.\r\n\r\n“Master… I serve you,” came a must deeper voice than Fran’s.\r\n\r\nThe oinking returned and from the shadows of the new lair came a giant boar that slowly walked out as if not wanting to startle Delta.\r\n\r\nThe long white tusks, the dark brown fur, the black hooves all looked ready to inflict serious pain. But it was the red eyes that peered out from a single piece of rough armour that covered the pig that made Delta pause. Those eyes did not belong to a wild animal.\r\n\r\nOn top, almost missable upon first glance, sat an armoured figure. The slight gaps between hands and wrists, body and neck showed green skin.\r\n\r\nIn one hand, a giant crude metal spear. In the other, the black leather reins to direct the pig.\r\n\r\nThe goblin wore crude plate armour thick enough to actually protect from ranged arrows and most basic blunt weaponry and the occasional sword swing.\r\n\r\nDelta felt afraid for a moment as if the pig would charge at her. Then she remembered she was a ghost and started to breathe again.\r\n\r\n“Fran?” she asked and the goblin raised his helmet to show a grinning face. It felt almost right but not quite so Delta tried again.\r\n\r\n“Sir Fran, the Pig Knight,” Delta smiled as the name felt like the final deal in the whole matter and torches burst into light all around the room, like a roaring applause.\r\n\r\n“At your service, my lady,” he and his pig bowed as one.\r\n\r\nDelta took it all back, her monsters were adorable. She hid a smile as the pig bowed too low and Fran fell off, face-planting with a growl.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe village of Durence moved on with its life. A man bargained with the baker, haggling the price of his wheat down as the tiny fire crystal at the back of the baker shop supplied heat to the ovens.\r\n\r\nA woman handed the bucket to a pulley system that a water pump drew water up into. The machine whirred and steam hissed out as the pump cooled. A man argued with a woman as she demanded help.\r\n\r\n“He’s been gone for almost half the day, his family is worried. Mr Sawn never leaves his farm or his family for long. He’s not even done his cow milking yet,” the woman huffed and the man sighed.\r\n\r\nHe ran a hand down his wrinkled jacket. The blue thing being passed from one generation of Peace Keeper to another. In a town this size, only one was ever really needed.\r\n\r\n“I can take a look about but Pinny, the man is an adult. If he went for a walk or found some peace finally, it’s not our place to poke our noses in. I got enough trouble with Headger melting his potion room wall and seeing his neighbour bathing, the husband is furious. Mrs Willings has gone and angered some pixies down the road and now her house is infested. I don’t think we need to call the king down for a man who\'s been missing less than a day or so. Jonnie and the boys hunted some gobs down, maybe one messed with his fence, you know Sawn keeps a Fire pistol handy,” Quiss assured the woman.\r\n\r\nShe soured her face then reluctantly agreed, her eyes lit up a moment later.\r\n\r\n“Did Headger really see Gody naked?” she whispered with delight and Quiss, only Peace Keeper in Durence, sighed.\r\n\r\nHe sent a pray above for anything to take his attention away from the nags and the gossips.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nDelta… choked.\r\n\r\nNo...nononononono.\r\n\r\nShe slid down the wall as the tiny box in front of her glowed with pride.\r\n\r\nDue to consumption of mass poison mushrooms, level 1 has ‘Mushrooms’ freely added to the decorations and will now sprout on their own in the dungeon for free! Poison is reduced from deadly to mildly toxic to avoid Mana consumption. You can upgrade this later!\r\n\r\nThen before Delta’s very eyes. A little mushroom poked out of the ground.\r\n\r\nIt wriggled and then stilled, enjoying its new home.\r\n\r\nThen a new box appeared.\r\n\r\nMushroom Grove room unlocked! Cosmetic room with no bonuses. May build the room, regardless of max rooms per floor!\r\n\r\nDelta screamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n----'),
('The Piggy in the Middle', 'There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.', 4, 'Delta didn’t have to wait long for Hob and Gob.\r\n\r\nThey announced themselves with a screech and an oink as they barrelled into the dungeon.\r\n\r\nDelta’s mouth dropped open as they carried a rather large pig into the tunnel, the animal squirming and squealing just as loudly as the goblins.\r\n\r\n“Mans!” Hob warned. Gob just screamed as the pig bit him.\r\n\r\nFran stood with a sharp look and rushed off towards the entrance, turning the corner in the new tunnel.\r\n\r\nGob threw the pig down and Delta closed her eyes for the next part but soon felt mana flow towards her.\r\n\r\nIt was plump and calm. Delta enjoyed the feeling, this feeling was much better than-\r\n\r\nShe gagged and her sight shot open as Hob dropped the dreaded mushrooms all over the dungeon floor. Delta bent over and felt winded as the vile taste of mushrooms overwhelmed her senses.\r\n\r\n“Man!” Gob shouted again and Delta tried to inhale as she watched her mana number grow.\r\n\r\nFrom a measly six all the way to twenty.\r\n\r\nThe pig just gave her 15 mana in a single pop. The remaining mushrooms pushed past her limit and struggled to reach a number beyond her max.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five.\r\n\r\nThen it began to trickle down as the excess mana seemed to leak away.\r\n\r\nThat was enough for her new monster if she hurried! Delta stumbled to her feet and to the first bend in her dungeon. She picked a spot close to the wall as the three goblins made warning noises at the person approaching the dungeon entrance.\r\n\r\nDelta focused.\r\n\r\n“Mushroom Spitter!” she ordered, and she saw her orb pulse once. Then from the ground, a cap appeared, it grew rapidly until Delta was staring at a mushroom almost as big as a child and firmly anchored in the ground. Then the living fungus wriggled and the stalk split apart horizontally to reveal a big toothy maw filled with some vicious green liquid, she would later deny having squealed in fright in any way, shape or form.\r\n\r\nIt gurgled at the dungeon as it blinked its two beady glowing eyes. It seemed to send some mental ‘I live to serve’ feeling at her before it focused intently on the corner where her goblins seemed to roar.\r\n\r\nDelta ordered them all back, curious to see what her new mushroom could do.\r\n\r\nThe grey flesh and dark cap made it blend well into the dungeon. It was then that Delta finally noticed that her dungeon was almost pitch black beyond the first turn. Didn’t dungeons have eternal torches or glow bugs?\r\n\r\nDid she see in some… UV or night vision? Mana vision?\r\n\r\nMushy, she deemed him, wriggled as the goblins ran past, understanding them as ‘Dungeon’, letting them past albeit with a sense of annoyance to him.\r\n\r\nDelta knew, just knew, if one of them had bumped into it, it would have chomped down with a vengeance. It didn’t seem to really like anything other than its damp wall.\r\n\r\n“Blasted gobs! Just get back here and give me back my pig!” a man shouted, his voice more angry than afraid. He turned the corner and Delta blinked as the man held a small… gun?\r\n\r\nDelta came closer, nervous but the man didn’t seem to sense her. The ‘gun’ was a stone device held in two hands, a small red crystal plugged into the handle and the wide muzzle of the gun had an almost cartoonish iron-sight.\r\n\r\nDelta goggled at it, trying to understand what she was looking at. The crystal glowed orange and Delta tried to see inside but the man moved through her. As the man drew neared too close Mushy did what Delta guessed was what Mushy would do in any circumstance.\r\n\r\nIt lashed forward and took a chunk out of the man’s leg. Delta blanched at the sight of the man\'s wounds but the man screamed and fired the device in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe end erupted into a gout of fire that consumed Mushy. The mushroom screeched and then promptly melted.\r\n\r\n“Mushy!” Delta screamed, feeling the awareness of the monster fade as it was killed. The man gasped and tried to pull himself up the wall, gun pointed down.\r\n\r\nDelta knew logically that the man had every right to defend himself and to get revenge on his pig. It was only fair.\r\n\r\nBut Delta also felt that a farmer with a boomstick was unfair. Really just unfucking fair.\r\n\r\n“Fran, Hob, Gob!” Delta yelled and the goblins rushed out. She closed her eyes, not enjoying the unfairness of the situation, on her side or the man’s.\r\n\r\nMana flowed, but Delta ignored it. This… this was not how she wanted things to go. This wasn’t how she wanted things to go at all.\r\n\r\nTo survive, she needed mana and DP. To get them, she needed time or resources.\r\n\r\nDelta either needed to kill or gather resources. Mushrooms came guilt free.\r\n\r\nShe would make the goblins understand… she didn’t want to kill anyone who didn’t…\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t fair. She shouldn’t have to be making moral codes for monsters and trying to live with the result.\r\n\r\n“Goblins… don’t steal from the mans again. Just… bring me things from the forest, that doesn\'t belong to man,” she begged and the goblins seemed to shuffle as they listened to the air.\r\n\r\n“No want piggies?” Hob asked quietly.\r\n\r\n“Not man’s piggies,” Delta agreed gently. Her mana had sky-rocketed from 11 to 32 due to the farmer’s demise. The gun on the ground was also dissolving quickly.\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t a normal world of farmers and knights… that thing reeked of technology.\r\n\r\nShe created a new Mushy on the same spot, the thing shivering as if still upset at the previous Mushy’s death. Delta was sure they were different mushroom monsters, they had different markings on their cap.\r\n\r\nThe man had been worth 21 mana. More than her max total. With her new Mushy, the result dwindled back down to 19.\r\n\r\nThe gun finished breaking apart, the crystal the last thing to go.\r\n\r\nHer mana shot to 69 and Delta blinked as a little box appeared.\r\n\r\n    “Torches have been added to Construct menu due to fire element”\r\n\r\n    “Goblin campfire has been added to construction menu due to fire element.”“Flame gout trap(weak) added to construction menu due to fire element”\r\n\r\nDelta wanted to squirm and look but the mana was already beginning to dip lower.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the main core room and fired another hallway tunnel to the north, the earth quickly giving way to the space. Moving to the end, she created a room, it crumbled into an almost perfect shape, but she was still 19 mana up.\r\n\r\nDelta moved back to her first bend and threw down a pitfall trap. It left her with 14 over, after a moment\'s thought, she created an another Mushy in her core room, bring the total mana to 21.\r\n\r\nThe last mana held on, and she blinked, not sure why it wasn’t fading. Opening the menu, she felt surprise rise up as her max total mana was now 25.\r\n\r\nWhen… how did it grow? Delta knew she had 20 exact when she began to spend. She built a hallway, like she did before, another Mushy after the second bend in the entrance tunnel and… a room.\r\n\r\nDelta eyed the new room, the deepest part of her dungeon now. It felt like she was less crushed. As if her mind had more space to stretch itself.\r\n\r\nA room added 5 more max mana. That was interesting, a lovely little discovery.\r\n\r\nDelta closed her eyes and sent a small prayer for the farmer, his death was helping her, and she needed to ease the bubbling guilt rising up, even if the way he charged into a cave after a pair of goblins was Darwin awards level stupid.\r\n\r\n“Thanks…” she added lamely, not particularly religious but still hoping it helped.\r\n\r\nShe eyed the furthest room as the two goblins left for the forest.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to have her core there than in the middle of the dunge-\r\n\r\n    Would you like to move your core? Cost 10 DP.\r\n\r\nDelta stared for a moment and then clicked yes without a word.\r\n\r\nOne day she would finish a monologue without having handy notifications solve her problems. She paid the price, choking as she saw she had 82 DP.\r\n\r\nThe core rumbled and flashed, the earth altar holding it breaking apart.\r\n\r\nThe Orb floated gently up the tunnel and then with another groan the earth rose up and gripped the core tightly.\r\n\r\nJust like that, she had a new core room, with another room to defend her! Delta snorted, soon she would be good enough to be called a tutorial dungeon…\r\n\r\nWith some grumbling, she moved back to the old core room and saw a Mushy was still skulking in the shadows.\r\n\r\nDelta hummed, it\'d be a shame to have this whole room dedicated to one Mushy and there was that… lair thing she could buy.\r\n\r\n“Can I move the mushroom?” she asked and the little box appeared.\r\n\r\n    Moving stationary monsters cost 1 mana and takes 10 minutes, Would you like to move the Mushroom Spitter?\r\n\r\nIt asked just as she guessed. Delta felt smart and crouch down to stare with some interest as the mushroom glowered as it was slowly transported into the hallways by what looked like a magic plant pot of all things.\r\n\r\nDelta began to flick through the menus after a minute. Magic was cool but a slowly fading mushroom being carried down the hall was not as great as it seemed.\r\n\r\nThe things she could outright buy….\r\n\r\n    Mana: 20/25.

A map opened up in front of her and the only empty room flashed for confirmation. Shrugging, Delta tapped it and the surrounding room shifted as earth rose and the walls bulged slightly. Tiny hay-filled alcoves formed and a single stone hut, small enough for a dog a or a crawling goblin formed.\r\n\r\nDelta grinned as she saw the changes she had brought with a single push of a button. The lair seemed to be a resting spot for humanoid monsters, the alcoves suggesting a place to snooze between battles.\r\n\r\nShrugging, Delta added the fire goblin fire pit and a box appeared.\r\n\r\n    Would you like to make the Lair into a goblin camp? Bonus healing to Goblins!\r\n\r\nDelta hit confirm the room changed to have empty racks of meat. The alcoves were replaced with small tribal huts and a decent sized fire roared to life in the centre, lighting the room up as it crackled with merry purpose. Fran appeared and began to praise her.\r\n\r\nDelta waved it off, feeling a blush coming to her ghostly face.\r\n\r\nFran sat down, warming his hands by the fire.\r\n\r\nDelta smiled at his delighted face. She opened the menu and browsed through the upgraded menu.\r\n\r\n    Upgrade menu. Total DP: 52.

Picking me up, spinning me about, he declared “Gotcha!”\r\n\r\n“Ok, ok” mom said, ever the serious one. “Put Elaine down so she can tell us what she got.”\r\n\r\nI settled in as mom got us all breakfast, and started to share all of the skills I had gotten. I was surprised at the end that mom was frowning.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t get a single social skill? No [Bartering], no [Chatting], no [Charming], not even [Gossip] or anything similar? Are you sure Elaine? I know you’re not a big fan of playing with the other kids, but you shouldn’t hide skills from us. You were playing with Lyra just the other day, you went bartering with dad, you should’ve gotten SOMETHING.”\r\n\r\nI continued to get the stink-eye as I insisted I didn’t have any of those skills.\r\n\r\n“Alright Elaine, why don’t you go down to the river and do some laundry while dad and I talk? Please don’t allocate any of your points while you’re at it.”\r\n\r\nI could tell when I was being given busy-work to keep me out of their hair, but I did want to get Lyra’s tunic clean for her. And I could finally walk outside of the grey zone by myself! Feeling Very Important as I walked down the white zone, I almost missed the cry of “out of the way”. I froze for a moment, then realized they were probably yelling at me! Without looking I threw myself into the grey zone, only to see a wagon going full speed in the light early morning traffic. Everyone involved preferred that Elaine-flavored mango paste did NOT end up all over the road.\r\n\r\n[*ding!* You’ve unlocked the General skill [Dodging]!]\r\n\r\n[Dodging: With quick reflexes you’ve dodged death or dismemberment. This skill will help you do that again. Increased reflexes, speed, and perception per level when dodging]\r\n\r\nWell, sure, I guess. Near-death experience, new skill. I wasn’t complaining about getting the skill, but the DAMN LUNATICS DRIVING IN THE ROAD NEEDED TO PAY ATTENTION. Traffic. Couldn’t get rid of it even through space and time. I suspect if I had gotten hit, I would have been doing a lot more than complaining. The rest of the trip and the wash was uneventful, and I got to happily share with the other women at the communal laundry that today was THE day I unlocked, and I was working on figuring out what skills to pick. Naturally, everyone washing clothes at the river had inputs. Some of the ladies had nice Aura skills that helped people be calm and happy, or did something else nice. Usually they formed the center of a cluster, and today I got a minor experience of what that was like as everyone wanted to give me their advice. It was nice, but I could see it getting old.\r\n\r\n“Get [Knitting]! Great for making your own clothes, can’t be beat!”\r\n\r\n“You simply MUST try to get [Bartering]! Merchants will fleece you otherwise poor dear.”\r\n\r\n“Oooh, [Pretty] is a great passive! Lots of fun” one of the prettier ladies advised me.\r\n\r\n“[Teach Children]!”\r\n\r\n“[Running]!” “No [Walking]!” “[Running]!” “[Walking]!” Two ladies did their best impression of ‘Duck Season/Rabbit Season’ as they argued the merits of running vs walking. I missed Looney Tunes.\r\n\r\nIt was nice having everyone fuss over me and to chat with everyone, but the morning was hot, and soon enough the clothes I brought were dry. Everyone having an opinion and telling me what to take was draining as well – I was overwhelmed, and they weren’t helping. I took them off of the communal drying line, and headed back home, blessedly uneventfully.\r\n\r\nI made it home, to find mom and dad waiting for me. They clearly had figured out what skills and stats I was going to get. I tensed, waiting for their verdict, the grand parental judgment to be handed down. On one hand, I wanted to be my own person, I wanted to make my own choices. On the other, they had a pretty good idea of what skills were good, and what skills were suboptimal. Listening to them, following what they said, had a solid chance of helping me out down the line.\r\n\r\n“Elaine. We’ve decided. The two of us together are picking a skill for you to have, then we’re each picking out two skills we think you should have. That’ll give you three skills for you to pick yourself! Ok?”\r\n\r\nThat… didn’t sound awful. I was cautious though. I wasn’t going to surrender without a fight.\r\n\r\n“Maybe… what skills are you picking?”\r\n\r\n“Elaine.” Dad’s face looked like a thunderstorm. Uh oh, I’ve stepped in it now. “This isn’t really a negotiation. We could pick out all eight skills for you if you’d prefer.”\r\n\r\nDespots! Tyrants! This was a democracy, not a dictatorship!\r\n\r\nHang on, was it? There was no schooling, no civics lessons, and it had never come up. I had assumed we were living with a king, etc., but I had never learned the word for king, and there seemed to be a complete dearth of nobles. And we lived in the Republic of Remus, and there’d been that voting day a few years ago… I filed the thought away for another time.\r\n\r\n“Fine, fine. What skills am I getting?” I asked, throwing my hands up in surrender.\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ve both decided that you need [Identify]. Almost everyone has it. It’ll help you figure out how good someone is, pick the right shopkeeper, and help you avoid danger.”\r\n\r\nI focused, and found [Identify] in my menus.\r\n\r\n[Identify: You’ve looked around the world, and you want to know more. This skill will help you grasp basic information and identities from people and creatures around you. Increased range per level. Current range: .5 Meters]\r\n\r\nThis… didn’t seem to be the worst skill to get. Not sure why it was displayed in metric, ‘meters’ weren’t a thing here, but there was no telling with all-powerful magical systems. Ok, let’s do it.\r\n\r\n“I pick Identify!” I proudly announced. Dad’s thundercloud face suddenly became a poker face. Mom shouldn’t play poker, as she fell off the chair laughing. Nothing else happened, as mom’s gasping, wailing laughs filled the home. Well, nothing else except my face turning beet red, and a strong desire to mimic an ostrich filled me. “Well, how do you get a skill then?” I asked with not a small amount of anger. Tell me these things damnit!\r\n\r\nDad, slowly, word by word, with great restraint, trying to avoid making me feel any worse: “Just focus on the skill, and think about selecting it. If you ever need to replace a skill, focus on the skill you’re replacing at the same time.”\r\n\r\nSeemed easy enough. I closed my eyes, and focused on [Identify].\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Congratulations! You’ve learned [Identify] – level 1!]\r\n\r\nHumiliation from earlier fresh in my mind, I decided I’d look before I leapt, and ask how to do things before trying.\r\n\r\n“How do I use [Identify]?”\r\n\r\n“Look at me, then focus on using [Identify]. It’ll take some practice at first, but you’ll get the hang of it.”\r\n\r\nI looked at dad, and followed his directions. My mana dipped one point. A SKILL! MAGIC! Huzzah!\r\n\r\n[Warrior]\r\n\r\nWell, that wasn’t all that useful. I guess it was because I was so low-level. Or that the skill was low-level. Just telling me he was a warrior didn’t do all that much. I thought he was a guard? Shouldn’t I be getting useful information? And why was it pink?\r\n\r\n“Why am I getting a pink warrior back dad? You’re a guard, right?”\r\n\r\nDad looked like he ate a surprise lemon. “Light red dear, I’m light red. Everyone starts off white. As you level up, you get redder and redder! They say the strongest humans are a bright, vivid red! Scary! If you see a [Warrior] that’s very red, you know they’re dangerous. If they’re white, you know they’re low-level. To help you get an idea, my highest class is level 183 – [Stout Guard]. Please don’t tell other people what my class is. Generally, it’s kept a secret. Alright, walk over to the door, then try to [Identify] mom.”\r\n\r\nI did exactly what he said, but nothing happened. I looked over puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Remember how it told you the range was 1 Ra? That’s how we defined how much a Ra was!”\r\n\r\nThat wasn’t at all what I had, but along with [Child of Earth], which my parents hadn’t asked about yet, it seemed like there was a strong influence on how my system was displaying for me vs everyone else. Stay calm, stay undercover, genie stays in the bottle. I should really consider taking that [Acting] skill. A shame there wasn’t a [Deception] skill, but that was probably a social skill, and I seemed to be allergic to those. So, I nodded, doing my best impression of a worldly sage. I got more strange looks, but I doubted they would investigate more.\r\n\r\n“Good! Come closer, and try again!”\r\n\r\n[Laborer]\r\n\r\nwas mom’s result.\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Congratulations! [Identify] has reached level 2!]\r\n\r\nI leveled up! “Hurray! Leveled up! If levels are this easy, I’m going to get level 200 in [Identify] by lunch!”\r\n\r\nMom and dad laughed a pure, tinkling laugh. “The first levels are easy; the later levels are hard. You’re also capped by your highest class’s level. You got [Child of Remus] right? What level?”\r\n\r\nI froze in the spotlight, guilt written large on my face. They noticed my discomfort, given that my poker face was basically a freshly-cleaned, well-polished window, and got excited.\r\n\r\n“Ooooh! Did you get [Child of Pallos]?” Mom swooped in and hugged me.\r\n\r\nMore frozen face. Think. THINK! I was so petrified; I couldn’t think. Confused looks on my parent’s face – what else was there beside [Child of Pallos] and [Child of Remus]? Time to come clean I guess, and see what the fallout was.\r\n\r\n“I got… [Child of Earth]” I winced, waiting for the inevitable incrimination, the temple vivisectionists coming to get me.\r\n\r\n“Oh my! You’re beloved by the earth element! That’s wonderful!” Dad picked me up and twirled me around. “You’ve GOT to get an Earth class next! I assume [Child of Earth] is earth-aligned? It must be.”\r\n\r\nEarth. Earth. By the sweet spines of Etalix, I WAS SAVED! Saved by the overlap on words! Saved by a complete lack of imagination from whoever named planet Earth! I wasn’t going to correct dad on this, I nodded furiously. “For some reason, it’s a Wood affinity though. But three free stats a level!” I hastily added in, hoping to distract from the Wood part.\r\n\r\n“Fantastic! Wonderful! What level did you get? Early levels are all so white, it’s really hard to tell individual levels apart.”\r\n\r\n“Level 8! Right to the top!”\r\n\r\n“Whoa Elaine, careful! Don’t class up before getting your general skills and training them a bit! You get better classes with better skills! On that note, I’d like you to get [Knives] and [Cleaning].” Bleh. Cleaning. I was hoping to avoid that. Although – I had so many chore-related skills, maybe I’d be allowed this as a catch-all. I decided to take a look at the skills I was being asked to take.\r\n\r\n[Knives – You have a floundering love of knives. This skill will make it a little easier to wield knives. Increased proficiency and handling per level. Mana Regen -2 when using a knife.]\r\n\r\n[Cleaning – You’ve been reluctantly gang-pressed into cleaning everything around you, and have achieved a small mastery of it. Increased ability to spot messes and clean them up per level. 2 Mana per minute when in-use]\r\n\r\nAh well. I focused on the skills, and was rewarded with seeing them slot into my general skills. Three down, two I didn’t mind.\r\n\r\n“Ok Elainus, now shoo. We need to have some girl talk.” Mom shooed dad out the door.\r\n'),
('Title Drop', 'Beware of Chicken', 9, 'Rice. The staple of the world. White rice is delicious. But like all grains, it is a supreme amount of effort. After you husk it, then you have to pound it even more to get the bran and germ off.\r\n\r\nWhite rice also has a lack of several important vitamins. With removing the hull of the rice, you rid it of vitamin B1, essential to the process of the human body. And then, with a lack of B1, you get beriberi. Shortness of breath, swollen legs, nerve damage. And finally, death.\r\n\r\nNasty way to go, if you ask me.\r\n\r\nSo well I was perfectly capable of swiftly husking and polishing my rice, I kept myself back, and decided only to do half white and half brown.\r\n\r\nEven with my cultivator enhanced constitution, fully harvesting my rice was a lot of work. Threshing, husking, polishing… I was two days in already, and still had a lot to go. But then again, my yields had vastly exceeded my expectations. I had half an acre of rice on the hill. I was about half done, and had already filled fourty-two 40 kilogram bags, the standard measure here. I would need to make more just to hold my stuff!\r\n\r\nTruthfully, I didn’t know how much I would need for the winter, so better too much than too little, but Jesus.\r\n\r\nStill, nothing was wasted. The husks and the stalks I would turn into fertilizer, or occasionally kindling. I was actually looking forward to winter. From Jin’s memories, it was significantly milder than the ones I was used to. But then again, I’m used to -20 celsius, with dips down into the -40s, and massive amounts of snowfall. It even ended before April! Wonder of wonders!\r\n\r\nOh, man, I was going to build the biggest snowman ever! It would be The General That Commands The Winter, Bane of Cultivators everywhere!\r\n\r\nHeheheh.\r\n\r\nI just hoped one of my carrots would be big enough for a truly giant schnoz. You can’t have a snowman without a carrot.\r\n\r\nI breathe in, and then out.\r\n\r\nThe sounds of the farm washed over me. The oinks of Peppa and Chunky, the clucks of the hens, the chirps of the newly hatched chicks. The little ones had come into the world just last week, and already they were making nuisances of themselves, and running Big D ragged making sure none of them died.\r\n\r\nAh, This is the life.\r\n\r\n/////\r\n\r\n“Brother Jin certainly lives far enough away.” Gou Ren complained as they walked with their few tools towards where Jin had said his home was. His thick eyebrows were drawn down in annoyance, and his scowl nearly reached his bushy sideburns. “And does he even need help with his harvest? Hes only been there seven months, he can’t have too much to bring in.”\r\n\r\nGou Ren had been grumbling about the walk since they started– but Gou Ren always grumbled, so it was just something everybody in Hong Yaowu put up with. He always ended up doing what he was tasked with, though, so it was tolerated by most.\r\n\r\n“Ah, but brother, if he is already done, then all we’ve done is take a walk, and then enjoyed another’s hospitality.” Yun Ren said cheerfully, ever the pragmatist. His eyes were locked in his perpertual squint, and his ponytial bounched with each step. He was slightly shorter than his younger brother, but Gou Ren was one of the taller men in the village.“Besides. We need to escort our flower here, and keep her purity safe, as our illustrious chief has commanded.”\r\n\r\n“Meiling? A flower?” Gou Ren scoffed with a teasing grin, retreading an old game between them, “The only plant she resembles is a bunch of thistles. If you embraced her, you’d only get pricked.”\r\n\r\nMeiling scowled. “I’ll remember that remark the next time you beg me to cure your ills, Little Gou. I seem to remember somebody moaning in their bed roll over a stomach ache, and begging me to save them from death– when it turned out to be a build up of gas.”\r\n\r\nGou Ren’s face flushed while his brother started laughing. “Hey! You said you wouldn’t tell anybody about that!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, did I?” Meiling pretended to ponder, “I remember no such promise, after all, I’m just a bunch of thistles, poking people~”\r\n\r\nYun Ren pretended to sigh and shook his head. “You should know better than to go to a battle of wits when you’re unarmed, brother.”\r\n\r\nGou Ren spluttered at his brother’s betrayal, while Meiling and Yun Ren shared a smile. He huffed, and started walking faster.\r\n\r\nMeiling was certain they were close, because she had started to smell the faint scent of earth and the harvest. It was an invigorating smell, full of life, and had none of the faint acrid tang most qi had.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I think I see a fence!” Gou Ren declared, and indeed, they were swiftly approaching a barrier at the end of the road. “I think we’re here.”\r\n\r\nIt was a sturdy fence, at the bottom of a hill, composed of large logs, stripped of their branches and driven into the earth, and then cross-hatched with planks.\r\n\r\nMeiling looked bemused at the sign hung prominently beside the open gate.\r\n\r\n““Beware of Chicken?”” Yun Ren asked. “Am I reading that right?” He asked Meiling, and she nodded.\r\n\r\nBoth brothers laughed. “Brother Jin has an odd sense of humor,” Gou Ren declared, “Why would anyone fear a chicken?”\r\n\r\nSomething thumped to the ground in front of them.\r\n\r\nIt was a hawk’s head, it’s eyes plucked out.\r\n\r\nThey looked from the hawk’s head, back up to the top of the fence. A magnificent rooster, wearing a fox fur vest, cocked it’s head to the side and stared at them.\r\n\r\nThe brothers yelped.\r\n\r\nMeiling gaped. It was half hidden by the scent of earth, but the rooster smelled like… the moon!? How was the moon even a smell?\r\n\r\nThe Chicken seemed to decide something, and hopped down from the fence to land in the middle of the gate.\r\n\r\nThen it swept into a graceful bow, it’s wings splaying out to the sides. It stayed that way, and was watching them.\r\n\r\nMeiling realised what it was looking for.\r\n\r\n“Yun Ren, Gou Ren, bow.” She muttered to them, and dipped into a bow of greeting.\r\n\r\n“What, to the chicken?!” Gou Ren asked.\r\n\r\n“It’s a Spirit Beast. Bow.”\r\n\r\nThey bowed.\r\n\r\nThe Rooster stood once more, satisfied and nodding it’s head. Then it walked to the side of the fence, and held its wing out, to beckon them in.\r\n\r\nGou Ren looked at it warily.\r\n\r\n“Who is afraid of a chicken.” Yun Ren mocked him as they walked onto the land.\r\n\r\n“Shut up.” Gou Ren hissed.\r\n\r\nIt bowed once more, once they were inside the fence, a quick dip of it’s head, and then walked in front of them, as they walked up the small hill.\r\n\r\nAnd that was where the real surprise lay.\r\n\r\n“Gods above, this was all forest and stone last year! Some of the rocks were bigger than a house!” Yun Ren gasped.\r\n\r\nThey gazed upon gentle, rolling hills and fields, flush with verdant grass. A river wound it’s way down a hill filled with terraced rice paddies, some with still drying rice in it. It would not look out of place in a land that had been cultivated for decades, not mere months.\r\n\r\nA small house, and a larger storage shed sat on top of the hill, along with another smaller fence. Chickens clucked, pigs oinked, and they could hear the steady pounding of a person husking rice.\r\n\r\nMeiling took in the air. It was heavenly. It was clean and pure, mixed with something lightly spiced and fiery, and the everpresent smell of life.\r\n\r\n“Look at that rice,” Gou Ren muttered. “I’ve never seen that much rice in one field before, and it’s only half done. What kind of man is Brother Jin, to do all of this himself?!”\r\n\r\nTheir musings were interrupted by the chicken letting out a mighty cry.\r\n\r\nThe pounding stopped, and Jin’s voice came from within the house, speaking in another language, the one he had told Meiling about.\r\n\r\n“You tell ‘em Bi De!”\r\n\r\nThe chicken crowed again, and Jin stepped out.\r\n\r\nMeiling stared. His shirt was off, exposing tanned, rippling muscles slick with sweat. Jin’s look of contentment changed to happiness. A bright grin overtook his face.\r\n\r\n“Meimei! Brother Yun Ren, Brother Gou Ren! Welcome to the Fa Ram!”\r\n\r\n“Brother Jin! We’ve come to see if you needed help with the harvest!” Yun Ren called.\r\n\r\nJin looked surprised, and then genuinely grateful.\r\n\r\nMeiling Stared.\r\n\r\nGou Ren poked her in the back, and she jolted. “Stop drooling, Meimei.” he scolded, amused. Red crawled up her face.\r\n\r\nJin laughed. “I wouldn’t say no to some help, but what about your own harvest?”\r\n\r\nGou Ren shrugged. “They’ll be fine, I reckon, or else Elder Hong wouldn’t have sent us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you’re sure, I should be done in a day or two at this rate.” A day or two?! Meiling thought incredulously. “I was planning on heading up to the village anyways after I was finished, so I didn’t miss Meihua’s wedding.”.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, we’re at your disposal, Brother Jin.” Yun Ren declared.\r\n\r\nJin shook his head. “You’ve just arrived! Its not much, but I’ll give you the grand tour!”\r\n\r\nAnd so they trekked over the land, looking closer at his rice paddies, the stones carefully arranged by size, and a gravel pit, and the beginnings of a bridge over the river. While they walked, they regaled each other with stories of their time apart: a mere month, but there were some things to talk about.\r\n\r\nEven if some of it was needling each other.\r\n\r\n“A thistle, huh?” Jin asked with a smile. “I can see it. Medicinal. Tough enough to grow anywhere. And really, they are truly beautiful flowers, the same colour as her eyes.”\r\n\r\nThe Brothers looked at each other in shock, while Meiling covered her face with her hands, such was her embarrassment.\r\n\r\nYun Ren gasped exaggeratedly, and clasped his hands in respect. “Brother Jin, Your skill with complements humbles this Yun Ren”\r\n\r\n“Brother Jin, Your Tongue is silver and quick! Teach this unworthy Gou Ren your ways!” The other brother jokingly demanded.\r\n\r\nThey laughed as they continued walking, wandering down the small river.\r\n\r\n“What about that? Brother Jin, are you raising another house?” Yun Ren asked, pointing to slabs of stone, and planks of wood over the first, smaller river.\r\n\r\nAt this, Jin flushed.\r\n\r\n“…place isn’t big enough for more than one person.” he muttered, and his eyes flicked to Meiling, before darting away again.\r\n\r\nMeiling swallowed thickly, her heart pounding in her chest. Building a house for a family.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, building a house! Anyway! Here are the Lowly Spiritual Herbs–” He said, starting up his tour again.\r\n\r\nMeiling forced herself into motion, following along behind Jin, and out of the extremely pleasant images his words had conjuered. She hoped when she lived here that the spirit herbs would be a bit further away from the house, though. They smelled rather overwhelmingly of fire and cinders.\r\n\r\nThen she realised what she was thinking, and pinched her leg. When I live here?!\r\n\r\n//////\r\n\r\nJin was tireless. He did not even work at the speed beyond that of a highly skilled mortal, its just that he kept working. His hands moved at the same speed. His breathing was steady and even, and the work that needed to be done just disappeared.\r\n\r\nMeiling weaved more bags to pack away the rice in, while Gou Ren transported the dried rice to him, and Yun Ren helped harvest vegetables.\r\n\r\nAnd then, Jin made for them dinner. Strips of chicken filled with Spiritual herbs, squash, mushrooms and some spices, then crusted in leftover rice, and fried until crispy. It was served with baked carrots, radish, and freshly harvested rice.\r\n\r\nIt was the most delicious meal any of them had ever eaten.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nWhen those that shared the form of his Great Master had come, Bi De knew he was vindicated. None of them had the power and Majesty of his Lord. They were inferiors, and obviously here to give tribute.\r\n\r\nStill, there was no reason to be rude. He knew that guests were to be respected and cared for, unless they did something obscene They arrived at the opening to the Pillars, as was proper, and they exchanged proper courtesies, so they were allowed upon his Great Master’s Blessed Land.\r\n\r\nThey were similarly appropriate with their awe, for the Great Master was peerless upon this earth. And he was vindicated too, in having given them face by bowing to them, for his master bowed to them too. If he had not, he would have been greatly shamed. To not have the Disciple bow to honoured guests of his Great Master was utterly unforgivable.\r\n\r\nWith his Great Master, they too toiled in the land. They were utterly inferior to his Great Master, of course, but they worked with skill, and heeded his Lord’s words well.\r\n\r\nThey were worthy of respect, in that regard.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the time for the evening meal come, the Great Master took the plumpest of the females, one from the beginning, and slew her, as he slew the other birds that flew and sup on.\r\n\r\nBi De was shocked. His master had slain one of his own! Such a thing was beyond his comprehension.\r\n\r\nHe was shaken greatly by the act, so greatly, that he fled to the Great Pillars of the Fa Ram to contemplate this development. Would he be next?\r\n\r\nHe contemplated deeply the reasons for his Great Master to consume one of the Females, and found that such a thing was not as shocking as he first believed.\r\n\r\nThey were all his Great Master’s. They lived upon his Blessed Land, they supped upon his benevolence. But the Female had made no use of his master’s overwhelming generosity. She had grown fat, and had some amount of qi, but was not as he was. She had not ascended. She was as the interlopers he supped on, that ate of his master’s essence.\r\n\r\nThis was merely the Great Master’s essence returning to him, to once more nourish the new generation. Those who possessed skill, and the luck of the heavens, would ascend as he had. Those that did not would return to the Great Master.\r\n\r\nBi De nodded to himself, satisfied with his understanding. He would not be callously killed by his Lord.\r\n\r\nHe returned to His Great Master, and was given his measure of Heavenly Herbs, and he had affection lavished upon him, as all the other nights.\r\n\r\nThen, his master vacated his home, and gave his female guest great face by allowing her to lie in his bed , while he went to lie under a storage area, and the other males lied upon bed rolls outside.\r\n\r\nBi De prepared himself to assume the night watch, when the female stole out of the house, and towards his master. At first, he thought treachery, for only wicked beasts slunk around at night.\r\n\r\nHe followed her, and his Heavenly blades formed when she approached his Great Master’s prone form.\r\n\r\nShe woke him gently, and then slipped into his bedroll.\r\n\r\nBi De’s blades guttered out, as he comprehended the circumstances. She was not just A female, she was The Great Master’s female.\r\n\r\nThis had been a night of many revelations. Though he hoped Chun Ke and Pi Pa would not ascend, and instead be eaten. They were most annoying creatures.\r\n\r\n//////\r\n\r\n“Jin.”\r\n\r\nI awoke.\r\n\r\n“Meime-?”\r\n\r\nA finger to silence me followed by soft lips on mine.\r\n\r\nHer warmth beside me.\r\n\r\n“Only for a little.” She whispered.\r\n\r\nOur lips met again.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t for a little. I woke up to a shock of green tinted hair, and a warmth on my chest. Meimei was beside me, asleep and at peace.\r\n\r\nI hoped to wake up to that face again. '),
('Verdant Hill', 'Beware of Chicken', 5, 'Jin surely could have left first thing in the morning, and left them all in the dust on their way to the city.\r\n\r\nInstead, he was helping stack some of the crates of mushrooms with her little brother clinging to his back like a monkey. Meihua’s father had even given him an ox to borrow for their trip to the town, instead of him carrying his own load, as thanks for his help which sped the preparations considerably.\r\n\r\nAnd now her father was giving her pointed looks, and smirking when he caught her looking at Jin.\r\n\r\nHe hadn’t believed that they had just found and chased off a wolf. He thought they had snuck off to do…other things. Like kissing in the moonlight, or something equally ridiculous. It didn’t help that he had just completely ignored her when she told him her actual name, and just continued to call her Meimei.\r\n\r\nShe snorted, and buried her face back into the medical scroll. As if any man would want to do that with bony, freckly Meiling.\r\n\r\nShe saw, out of the corner of her eye, a wagon start to tip, as it’s wheel got stuck in a hole.\r\n\r\nJin lifted it out one-handed, without breaking stride, and winked when he caught her looking.\r\n\r\nShe scowled and looked away, hits of red blossoming on her cheeks.\r\n\r\nBastard.\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\nFor two days had the Great Master been gone, and for two days had Bi De kept the Great Master’s coop. None had so far dared to challenge him, no more of Basi Bu Shi’s ilk slunk around in the shadows. In his beak he held a twig that was split many times to form bristles, and swept away the dirt that threatened to invade where it wasn’t wanted. Soon, he would be able to use his wings for this, but not yet. His Great Master’s medicines were most potent, turning what should have been a life ending injury into a mere inconvenience. Loath as he was to have consumed such rare reagents, his Great Master’s beneficence was impossible to refuse.\r\n\r\nHe stalked among his master’s crops, and tried to empower them as his Great Master did. His efforts were laughable compared to his Great Master, and only revealed the truly vast gulf between them. On the first day, merely tending to the herb pots sent him to the ground, gasping and dizzy from exertion, with barely enough strength to sup upon the lesser beasts that came to try and eat them. His master could work the entirety of The Great Fa Ram without breaking sweat. Truly, his Great Master’s power was beyond his current comprehension.\r\n\r\nHe stalked back to his own pavilion, in the place with all the females. They were… disappointing to him in some ways. They held not the same spark as he, despite being in the Great Master’s presence, and occasionally consuming some bit of Heavenly Herb.\r\n\r\nHe wondered why, yet could not come up with a satisfactory answer. It was beyond his current comprehension.\r\n\r\nHe shook himself, and attended once more to Great Fa Ram.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nVerdant Hill crested the horizon. It was a town of about two thousand people, on top of a hill. Unlike Meimei’s little village of about 50, Verdant Hill had some impressive walls to it, and a palace looking administrative building in the center of it.\r\n\r\nThe people of our little caravan were surprised that we made such great speed. Normally they arrived late on the second day, but this time we got into Verdant Hill early in the morning of the second day. The distance itself wasn’t too far, but, you had to cross an extremely hilly section to actually get here. Though to call them merely hills was a disservice, they were damn near mountains, and the carts had to travel single file.\r\n\r\nThe geography here was really weird. Lots of potholes on the road too. I may have to fix that, if only for my sake.\r\n\r\nOur party was Meimei, her little brother, Xian, her father, who was also named Xian, The getting married girl (Meihua), her dad (Yao Che), and two more young men (Gou Ren and Yun Ren), who were supposed to help unload the mushrooms, and other goods.\r\n\r\nThe guards seemed to know Meimei’s father, and so waved us in without any trouble, and I bowed to Yao Che in thanks for letting me borrow the ox…even though I hadn’t actually needed it.\r\n\r\nIt was the thought that counted, and I greatly appreciated his generosity. We all agreed to meet up at the inn later. We would be staying the light at least, and maybe another night too. We all departed after stabling the animals, and locking away our carts. Meimei was instructed to bring a bottle of what I assumed was alcohol to “Brother Bao” by her father, while the rest went off to sell mushrooms at the exchange.\r\n\r\nWell, first things first. Time to (hopefully) find out what the weird root was. It was still back at the farm, but I had drawn a fairly good rendition of it.\r\n\r\nI could feel Meimei’s eyes on me, as I set off. We were heading in the same direction.\r\n\r\n“You headed to the Archives too?” I asked her, and after she looked at me suspiciously for a moment, nodded.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, as we walked, until Meimei spoke.\r\n\r\n“What are you looking for at the Archives? I may be able to help you find it.” she offered.\r\n\r\n“Trying to get out of making dumplings for me by doing me a different favour, Meimei?” I teased. The girl rolled her eyes, but I could tell she was amused, while I chuckled. “I take it you’re familiar with the Archives then?”\r\n\r\n“Father used to be an Imperial clerk, before he had to go back to the village and take up grandfather’s place when he passed. I spent most of my childhood in the Archives.” She replied, and once more had her “watching cat look” on her face, gauging my reaction.\r\n\r\n“Great!” I replied, and she looked shocked at my statement, “I don’t know what exactly I’m looking for, but I sketched it down. A root of some kind, wanted to know what it was.”\r\n\r\nI took out the picture, and the notes I had made, and handed it over to Meimei.\r\n\r\nShe recovered quickly though, and accepted my drawing as we reached the Archives. It wasn’t particularly large, but His Imperial Majesty had decreed that every town and city have one, along with a collection of standardized books and scrolls, and some more local knowledge. It also had land and tax records, and everything else an archive should have.\r\n\r\n“Well… come on then, I know the First Archivist, so we can start with him.” Meimei muttered, looking at my drawing. “I’m not supposed to be able to look at the advanced scrolls, now that father isn’t part of the Imperial clerks anymore… but Uncle Bao lets me anyways.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Lady Hong Meiling, she with friends in high places.” I said, putting on my most “courtly” voice, and Meimei actually laughed out loud, smiling brightly, before she realised what she was doing, and her smile dimmed.\r\n\r\nShe kept a cute little smirk though.\r\n\r\nWe ascended the stairs, the guards once more just waving Meimei through, and giving me an odd look, but then just shrugging and resuming their watch with bored expressions.\r\n\r\n“Uncle!” Meimei called, and we were rewarded with a happy gasp.\r\n\r\nUncle Bao was.. Well, bao shaped. A very rotund, balding man, but he looked jolly, with many smile lines on his face.\r\n\r\n“Mei’er! Daughter of my Brother Xian! It’s so good to see you again!” he exclaimed, and waddled around his desk so he could embrace Meimei, who contrary to my expectations seemed happy with the treatment.\r\n\r\n“It’s good to see you too uncle. Father sends his regards, and prays that you meet him at the usual place.”\r\n\r\nBao beamed at her, accepting the alcohol jug. “I shan’t miss it, Mei’er!”\r\n\r\nHe then turned to me, his eyes suddenly piercing. “And who does stand before me here?” he demanded of me.\r\n\r\nI smiled at him, and made the proper gesture of courtesy. Thank god for Jin’s memories, otherwise I would have fucked up which hand went where.\r\n\r\n“This one’s name is Jin Rou. I greet you, and hope that you have good health, First Archivist.” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Hes a friend of our family, uncle.” Mei whispered to him. “Father trusts him.”\r\n\r\nThe piercing quality suddenly went away, and Bao’s smile came back.\r\n\r\n“Well, for my Brother to trust you with his daughter, you must be a man of virtue!” Meimei’s face went red, but she didn’t say anything.\r\n\r\n“I’m guessing you want to use the archives, Mei’er? You know I can’t let you into the advanced scrolls. But I’ll be here in the back room if you need me, and I’ll be joining your father tonight! Mark my words well!”\r\n\r\nBao winked at her, and then waddled away. Meimei picked up a key he put on the desk.\r\n\r\n“To the archives?” she asked.\r\n\r\nThe guards ignored us as we walked up, and opened the locked door.\r\n\r\nWe grabbed the first of the scrolls on herbs, and sat down to read.\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\nJin was strange, Meiling thought, as she looked at him from the corner of her eye. Not even “strange for a cultivator”, but just strange. A lot of men had grimaced when they found out that she could read the Courtly Characters, or scoffed when they heard about her time in the Archives. Useless for a woman, they said.\r\n\r\nNever mind that she was the best at making medicine within 50 li. Never mind she knew how to cure the shaking fevers, how to set broken bones, and how to drain a cut to stave off infection. And she knew how to cook and clean and mend so she knew her womanly duties. She had taken care of her household ever since her mother’s passing.\r\n\r\nBut the archives just sealed the deal.\r\n\r\nThey saw gloomy Meiling. An impudent woman with a tongue like a knife, spitting poison at their “good sons.”\r\n\r\nJin had looked impressed. Happy even. And had willingly sat down with her amongst the mass of scrolls, as they got to work.\r\n\r\nAnd now they were sitting shoulder to shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe smelled of earth and the harvest.\r\n\r\nHer face flushed. She redoubled her concentration on the scrolls.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nI yawned and stretched. It was starting to get dark out, and today had been a bust so far. Nothing that looked even remotely like what I had, and we had gone through most of the scrolls on herbs.\r\n\r\n“C’mon, Meimei, we’ll look again tomorrow. I’ve got some stuff to do in the morning first though. Gotta sell my furs, and pick up some more supplies.”\r\n\r\nMeimei yawned too. She seemed annoyed that we hadn’t found anything., but nodded.\r\n\r\nWe started putting the scrolls away, when something caught my eye. A scroll Jin had read before. Contemplations of the Flamebud, it was titled.\r\n\r\nIt was a tale of two men.\r\n\r\nThey each find a Pearlescent Flamebud. It has taken a thousand years for it to bloom, to gather it’s power for the sole act of reproducing, spreading it’s pollen on the aetheric currents.\r\n\r\nOne of the men, upon finding this flower, cackles with joy. He tears it out of the ground, root and all. He shoves it into a spirit furnace, and burns away everything of the flower he deems superfluous, concentrating a sole aspect of it’s essence. He then consumes this pill, greedily devouring it’s essence to slightly improve his fire resistance.\r\n\r\nThe other man, upon finding the flower, is struck with it’s beauty. He contemplates the flower, the way it delicately draws in energy. They way it’s life disperses on the currents of the world, traveling far and wide to find a partner. He observes the cycle of it’s life, and when it finally withers, and begins storing energy to make it’s seeds… He thanks the flower for it’s wonderous life, and leaves, gaining little from the encounter.\r\n\r\nObviously, this wasn’t the way it was really told, lots more flowery language, and to cultivators, the moral of the story was basically “YEAH, SNORT THAT MAGIC FLAME FLOWER, THE OTHER GUY IS DUMB AND WEAK”\r\n\r\nJin Rou had agreed with that interpretation.\r\n\r\nMy only thought after remembering the story was “maybe all those contemplation guys actually ascend, while you’re all stuck here.”\r\n\r\nI shook my head, and finished putting away the scrolls. Meimei returned the key to the Archivist, and we wandered back through the pleasant night to the inn, and returned together, just as her father was about to go out.\r\n\r\nA massive, shit eating grin spread across his face.\r\n\r\n“Did you two have a good day together?” he questioned in a leading voice, just loud enough for the rest of the people of their village to hear, and Meimei flushed crimson.

('What Wicked Web We Weave', 'There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns.', 8, 'Delta watched as Francois gulped down another cream coloured mushroom; he looked to be rather enjoying it. The mushroom had taken a little over an hour to develop but when it finished, a little kitchen timer in Delta’s head went off.\r\n\r\nIt was cute, the noise, but Delta suspected she was being made fun of.\r\n\r\nIt was also concerning for later; the noise in her head when multiple developments finished would be… alarming. François looked puzzled at her snickering. Shame quickly filling her after that pun spurred her own to recheck the menu\r\n\r\n    Crunchy Mushroom: 3 Mana. A slightly odd mushroom that, while not all that good, can provide some nutrition. Leaves an aftertaste that lingers.\r\n\r\nThese mushrooms were just pale and featureless. Unlike the Gutrot, which were evil, these mushrooms seemed to make her little goblin happy as he chewed. Delta made a face as Francois smacked his little face.\r\n\r\nThough… that might be due more to the simpleness of a goblin mind that any refined palette. Leaving the goblin to eat the rest of her harvest, Delta went to ponder what her dungeon had… and didn’t have.\r\n\r\nGob and Hob still hadn’t returned with the water. She hoped they were alright, sure they were her only means of collecting resources and cheating the system but Delta was more concerned about them just coming back.\r\n\r\nThe brothers seemed… Delta shook her head, there was no denying it. Hob and Gob were important to her in a way that if they decided to never leave the dungeon again…\r\n\r\nDelta would provide for them, regardless. She cared for the little guys. It wasn’t something she felt shame or annoyance over. The gobs had asked for nothing and saved Delta from a very… tedious start to her new life.\r\n\r\nProviding something to look forward to each time they left and returned to tell her stories of their fetch quests. It was such a normal act, the greeting of a friend and the talk that followed, that she felt more than a little grateful towards them.\r\n\r\nShaking her head from such thoughts, Delta decided to do what she did best to pass time.\r\n\r\nMess with the menu and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nWith only 4 mana, there wasn’t much she could do. The mushroom grove had proven more than its weight in cost. A way to develop less poisonous mushrooms and maybe some more interesting strains.\r\n\r\nWhat other options did her less interesting purchases hide? Her fingers hovered over the spiders and bats.\r\n\r\nDelta held her finger down.\r\n\r\n    Common Spider: A simple black spider. Creates 5 spiders per summon. These little hand-sized creatures can add atmosphere and some free decoration to your dungeon. As basic creatures, they cannot evolve unless some unique element or being is absorbed by the dungeon.\r\n\r\n    Common Bat: A simple brown bat. Creates 2 bats per summoning. This average sized bat hangs about your dungeon to give it atmosphere and freak out the most easily startled of adventurers. As basic creatures, they cannot evolve unless some unique element or being is absorbed by the dungeon.\r\n\r\nBasic creatures was a new term. Delta felt like some cliche popular girl as she read them aloud.\r\n\r\n“Such a basic spider,” she said to herself and then snorted. Delta paced a hallway, nodding to a Mushy as she passed.\r\n\r\nBasic creatures were a classification between monster and decoration. Not really what you wanted to protect the Core but something a creative dungeon might be able to use with some excess mana to make their dungeon look more...spooky.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a little of a waste but Delta had learned her lesson after the umpteenth time since waking up. Dismiss nothing, everything is permitted. The line made sense in her head so Delta tried to imagine a use for the basic creatures.\r\n\r\nCould the spiders make some webs to slow people down? Then the bats could… scare people?\r\n\r\nSo… just like what her menu said they would do. Delta mumbled as she turned and walked back down the hall. The pacing was great. Pacing let her feel like she was some CEO of Dungeon. Inc.\r\n\r\n“Mr Cyclops, fetch me the 10 am readings! Dear Satan! Mr Werewolf! Have you seen these figures? Our Goblins are doing a protest! They want three more mushrooms a month!” Delta mimed throwing papers in the air.\r\n\r\nLaughing to herself until she calmed down; Delta sighed and tried to imagine taking any of this seriously to the point she got upset over spiders and bats. Delta just didn’t have time to be so asinine over the details. She’d get things done when she got them down.\r\n\r\nThat was when Hob and Gob returned, carrying a bucket that sloshed and spilt a bit of liquid on the ground.\r\n\r\nDelta raced towards them like a kid who had been waiting all day for someone to bring her presents for Christmas. Gob poured the water onto the dungeon floor and Hob dropped some slimy rocks and pebbles.\r\n\r\nThe water soaked in and the soil dried instantly as the water was turned into Mana and DP.\r\n\r\n    Common Water Absorbed! Algae absorbed! Pebbles absorbed!\r\n\r\n    Water themes unlocked in Menu!\r\n\r\nDelta grinned.\r\n\r\n“You guys did awesome!” she praised as her mana jumped from 4 to 26. That water was pretty good for the mana refill.\r\n\r\nThe DP was now sitting at 85 and Delta was starting to feel like a hoarder.\r\n\r\n“Hob and Gob best gobs!” Hob boasted with Gob enthusiastically backing him up with nodding. Delta let them go and was about to turn with a small cheer before another menu opened up.\r\n\r\n    Mushroom Grove will now develop all mushrooms at a faster rate and for 1 less DP across all options due to water element!\r\n\r\nDelta waved the menu away.\r\n\r\n“Away demon! Away with you!” she hissed. It flickered and a new pop-up took its place.\r\n\r\n    Goblins upgrade unlocked: All 1 tier goblins can now be summoned with a bag of rocks to throw at targets: 5 DP\r\n\r\n“Now, that\'s what I like!” Delta cheered and shrugged, purchasing the upgrade to spend it on something. She zoomed over to Hob and Gob to see a bag appear at their sides. It bulged and both gobs looked inside.\r\n\r\n“Rocks?” Gob asked and Hob grinned.\r\n\r\n“Rhucks!” he cheered and threw one at the Mushy in the tunnel. Delta gasped as the mushroom snarled, maw filling with that green liquid.\r\n\r\nBoth goblins ran screaming as bits of sick looking spit hit the walls and splattered down.\r\n\r\nWell... Delta never accused them of being smart.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty nice, however, that the basic goblin upgrades extended to her contracted monsters. She had a feeling that she was not truly catching on to the potential of the contracted monsters yet. Aside from being able to leave the dungeon, there had to be something else. Delta would have to keep waging war with the menus to tease the secrets out.\r\n\r\nA quick look at her menu showed her a few things.\r\n\r\n    Pond room: A room with a medium pond where fishing can take place. DP 10\r\n\r\nThat was neat, except for strapping wooden fake shark fins on her goblins, Delta had no fish for people to fish for. Still, options never hurt until they trapped her in a spiralling trap of unable to choose what to purchase.\r\n\r\nBut for now, she was rich in DP. Delta rubbed her hands as she saw a new tab unlocked on the menu.\r\n\r\n    Research Menu:\r\n\r\n        Irrigation: Study how to use water more efficiently to reduce the cost of crops that require water. DP 10\r\n        Basic Wooden Equipment: Be able to create weapons or basic armour of wood for loot drops or for Contracted Monsters able to use weapons. 5 DP\r\n        Basic Stone Equipment: Be able to create weapons or basic armour of stone for loot drops or for Contracted Monsters able to use weapons. 15 DP\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch was a word that smart people messed about with. Delta knew, as a modest shut in, that research meant that part of the game where you were able to take old and boring units or buildings and make them into somewhat still relevant pieces in the later game or take early parts of the game and using it to stay alive.\r\n\r\nA Grove might be able to produce more for less, for example. Delta pursed her lip; the thought came down to how to reduce the cost a room? A whopping 20 mana was still a bank drainer at this point.\r\n\r\n“Core improvement? Mana generator?” she asked aloud. Her menu did not respond in any fashion.\r\n\r\n“Yeah… figured that would be too easy,” she agreed amiably. Delta didn’t begrudge the system for not letting her take such an easy route. Delta had the tools to carve herself a way to sustain herself and her monsters.\r\n\r\nIt was just before her eyes in some fashion but Delta was in no rush to do something stupid when there was no direct danger yet.\r\n\r\nInstead, she decided to fill her dungeon with spiders.\r\n\r\nDelta would later regret this decision on many levels.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLooking at her mental map, Delta decided that she needed to mix things up once she had more mana. A new tunnel and another room.\r\n\r\nFor now, she created a room that connected to the first tunnel in the dungeon. It hollowed out and Delta took a small walkabout, admiring the almost perfectionist level of soil removal. She then flexed her fingers.\r\n\r\nShe purchased the spiders with 5 DP and five of the things scuttled out of a hole in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that happened was that Delta vacated the room without a word. Perhaps it was a new life, a stolen slew of memories, the excitement of her new powers but the little fact that Delta did not like spiders seemed to have escaped her.\r\n\r\nShe peered into the room and the spiders sort of… just moved around in interest in their new space.\r\n\r\nMaybe this wasn’t so bad; they almost looked cu- One of them turned to her and Delta fled.\r\n\r\nEight eyes of death and nightmares stared into her Core-y soul. Delta knew she should have started with bats but the idea had just gripped her.\r\n\r\nWith a very big shout, she ordered the spiders to begin to nest. It was the worst thing she had ever suggested since the phrase ‘Mushroom Grove’ had left her mouth.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the spiders began to web around the corners of the room and danced threateningly at each other as they fought for space, the silky white threads quickly growing as the spiders didn’t need to catch any food. Delta tried to project a command to the spiders not to web in a middle of the room, leaving two parts of the walls bare of web.\r\n\r\nIt was all part of her cunning plan! Delta felt pride rise up but it was quickly sent running as a spider poked out of the room to see where the cackling was coming from.\r\n\r\nThe eyes… Delta wilted and fled.\r\n\r\nOne day, Delta would make a monster that didn’t want to make her cry. Maybe something fluffy.\r\n\r\nDelta would later regret that thought on all levels.\r\n\r\n---'),
('Who You Gonna Call?', 'Cinnamon Bun', 3, 'The ghost followed. It didn’t make a sound, merely floated at a pace that was just a bit faster than walking, its long cloth-like robes fluttering in an invisible wind behind it as it trailed after me. Still, that look on its face, of indescribable rage and anger never faded, and the soft white glow of its eyes locked onto me and didn’t let go.\r\n\r\nI ran back through the crack in the wall, then back down the passage. I hoped that it wouldn’t follow, but that was dashed when first a hand, then an arm started to push through the wall. The ghost glowed faintly, especially where it was phasing through.\r\n\r\nStill, the motion slowed it down.\r\n\r\n“Rarr,” Bonsey said as I stumbled past him and into the office. Something, I needed something to hurt the ghost. I ran out with a bottle of wine that flew through the ghost’s form and smashed against a wall uselessly, the stick--once a chair leg--that I threw next did the same.\r\n\r\nI looked around, then picked up Bonesy’s head. “Bite him!” I said as I flung the skeletal head at my adversary.\r\n\r\nBonesy ‘rawred’ as he flew through the air, then, much to my surprise and that of the ghost, the skeletal head chomped down on the ghost’s face. “Rarg, ragr, rarre,” Bonesy said as he chewed.\r\n\r\nI stared, then it clicked. Bonesy was magic. Magic worked on ghosts. It was all rather obvious.\r\n\r\nRunning into the barracks, I passed the beds and moved into the bathroom. The showerhead glyph was stuck in a metallic basket above, one that wasn’t meant to be pried out of the wall, but I had desperation on my side. It came off with a clang and crunch, leaving me with a rusty metal basket and a magical, faintly luminescent stone in it that was still dripping water onto the ground.\r\n\r\nThe ghost had freed itself from Bonesy’s mouthy grasp but not without suffering from my boney friend’s cruel ministrations. There were tears in its ghostly form, and whitish vapour was pouring out of it.\r\n\r\nI edged closer to the ghost, hoping to slip by it, but the evil-no-good monster blocked my path and spread its arms out as if to give me the deadest hug ever.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry!” I said as I held the showerhead before me. “I just wanted to say hi.”\r\n\r\nThe ghost didn’t care, he, it, just advanced on me.\r\n\r\nI clocked it in the jaw with my magical showerhead.\r\n\r\nThe ghost wavered in the air, its face distorted, the anger turned to pain for a moment before returning tenfold. It swiped at me, but I ducked and moved so that a bed was between us. Its next swipe clawed through the mattress with ease.\r\n\r\n“I’m really sorry,” I said again as I moved up to the ghost and swiped through its entire body with the shower head from head to crotch. There was some resistance... then nothing.\r\n\r\nThe ghost split apart, both halves smoking as it turned into a fine white dust that spread across the floor.\r\n\r\nI sneezed.\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have murdered ‘Sentinel Ghost of Threewells by Darkwood’ Level 1! Bonus Exp was granted for brutally killing a monster above your level!\r\n\r\n“M-murdered?” I repeated before I tried to grab the box. “That wasn’t murder, it was self-defence! Self-defence! Where’s my jury of peers?”\r\n\r\n“Rar?” Bonsey asked.\r\n\r\n“You don’t count.” I snapped back; then I regretted it. Bonesy had helped a lot. “Sorry. I’m a bit stressed.”\r\n\r\nI brought my showerhead with me as I moved around, now vigilant for any ghosts. The Sentinel Ghost hadn’t seemed all that good at guarding really, but maybe there were more and maybe they patrolled. I would have to sleep with one eye open.\r\n\r\nStill, I had learned a few important lessons:\r\nGhosts weren’t magic resistant at all.\r\nThey were also scary.\r\nBonesy’s bites were serious business.\r\nThis place was probably called Threewells by Darkwood.\r\nA level one ghost was nearly strong enough to end my adventuring career.\r\n\r\nI needed to hurry up and level up. Get out there and face the music. Find more ghosts and murd-- cleanse their poor souls.\r\n\r\nYup.\r\n\r\nThat’s what I needed to do.\r\n\r\n“Hey, Bonesy, you wouldn’t mind if I cleaned up around here, right? Right, of course not.” Grinding a skill was also a perfectly valid way of spending my time, of course. It was a nice, soothing action and it in no way reminded me that I had almost turned into a ghost myself.\r\n\r\nI started with the papers, moving all of them to the chest in the barracks that looked the least worn. They might end up staying dry for longer in there, in case anyone ever wanted to read them. I intended to go over them myself, but I would need to bring them outside for the light and.... Later, maybe.\r\n\r\nI used the broom and mop as makeshift dusters and ended up sneezing up a storm as the room filled with age-old clouds of dust. By the time I was done and my sneezing fits stopped, I was greeted by a floating box.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Through repeated actions your Cleaning skill has improved and is now eligible for rank up!\r\nRank E is a free rank!\r\n\r\nA free rank? I thought about my Cleaning skill, and low and behold the menu for it appeared.\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank F - 100%\r\nThe ability to clean. As this skill rises in level your ability to Clean will improve!\r\nThis ability is ready to rank up.\r\n\r\nDo you wish to increase Cleaning to Rank E?\r\n\r\n“Sure?” I tried.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Cleaning is now Rank E!\r\n\r\nI blinked at the new box and reopened the skill to see the change.\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank E - 0%\r\nThe ability to clean. Your proficiency and instincts for cleanliness have improved! Clean faster, clean better.\r\n\r\n“O-kay,” I said. That was nice, I supposed. I hoped that cleaning was one of those skills that was versatile. I had to clean my clothes too at some point, and maybe take a shower later. Still, the progress was nice. I swept all the dust I had kicked up into a neat pile, then used a file folder to scoop it into one of the chests that was now a garbage chest.\r\n\r\nThen, out came the showerhead and mop and bucket. The spray was... weak, and my mana ticked down fairly quickly while using it, but it still gave me enough water to start scrubbing the floor.\r\n\r\nAn hour had passed, maybe more, before I glanced at my skills page again.\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank E - 06%\r\n\r\nSo, about five percent for one room. Which meant... not much. Slower than Rank F, which wasn’t too surprising. Shrugging, I looked over the office area. It was far from perfect. There were wet streaks on the ground and I couldn’t do anything about the broken furniture, but it looked like it had been abandoned last year instead of a decade or five ago.\r\n\r\nOh well.\r\n\r\nThe barracks were next, then the bathroom where I pinched my nose and wished for a nice pair of latex gloves as I cleaned around the wooden latrine hole. At least with the passing of decades anything... biodegradable, had rotted away to nothing.\r\n\r\nI wiped the sweat off my brow and looked over the newly cleaned room. There wasn’t much I could do about the mattresses, though I had found one that was filled with a slightly less moldy filling. If I really needed to sleep here, I could use that bed. Maybe.\r\n\r\nShrugging, I turned my efforts to the floor above, though there was little I could do in the armory except smash the wood into kindling and stack it neatly before mopping up the floor.\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank E - 14%\r\n\r\nI stared at the skills page for a while, then dismissed it. The sun had passed its zenith and was falling now, the skies not yet turning the yellow-orange of mid-day, but approaching it fast. That was fine. Totally okay.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t afraid of the dark.\r\n\r\nI was afraid of the ghosts living... unliving in it.\r\n\r\n“Oh boy,” I said. Cleaning was all well and good, but all I was doing was preparing a nice spot for my body to lay. That, and I was hungry. The lukewarm water from the showerhead was handy, but it wouldn’t fill my tummy up. “I need a weapon,” I said.\r\n\r\nI turned towards Bonesy. The skeletal head was resting on one of the desks, mouth working to chew through a piece of rotting wood with wet, mushy noises.\r\n\r\n“Any ideas?” I asked the head.\r\n\r\n“Rrr.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. I can’t exactly stick the shower head at the end of a stick and call it a mace. Your head would be a much better weapon.”\r\n\r\nI blinked.\r\n\r\nThere was some twine laying around, and cloth that could be used as rope. There was even a broken spear from the armory, more of a length of wood with a metal cap on the end than anything else, but it was usable.\r\n\r\nI got creative!\r\n\r\nNearly an hour and two almost-chewed fingers later, I had a brand new weapon!\r\n\r\n“Wraare!” Bonesy said from his place of pride at the end of my spear. The shaft was stuck through the hole for his spine and into his braincase, and I\'d wrapped him in strips of cloth to keep him from rattling around. I didn\'t want to blind him, though, so I left a gap for his glowing eyes to glare out of.\r\n\r\n“I shall dub this weapon... The staff of Bonesy! No, that’s silly. The Ghostbuster? The bone stick? The boner club?” I flushed. “Not that last one.”\r\n\r\n“Rrrr,” Bonesy agreed.\r\n\r\nThus armed, I prepared myself to explore once more. My trusty showerhead in my haversack, my Bonesy stick in one hand and all my prayers in mind as I stepped out into the fading daylight.\r\n\r\nNo ghosts in sight.\r\n\r\nI moved slowly around the buildings again, tiptoeing as quietly as I could while taking in the town. The homes were in rough shape, but could probably have been renovated and repaired with a bit of love and care. I bet there was a Carpentry skill out there somewhere.\r\n\r\nAs I rounded the corner, I took in a little plaza with a few smaller homes and a big stone well in the middle. There were more homes than I had initially realized, maybe twenty or twenty-five in all.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until I was nearing the main road that I saw the second ghost.\r\n\r\nThis one looked rather pitiful, floating nearer to the ground, its cloth-like flesh... stuff, all torn up. It seemed to be moving around in a big circle at a slow, shuffling pace. I didn’t want to fight it, I really didn’t.\r\n\r\n“Hey there, Mister Ghosty,” I said.\r\n\r\nThe ghost\'s floating stopped and it slowly turned towards me. Its dull eyes searched around then locked onto me. It frowned.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean any trouble,” I said before raising both hands up in surrender.\r\n\r\nThe ghost charged.\r\n\r\nWell, charge implies rapid movement. The ghost shambled forward like a plastic shopping bag on a windless afternoon. “I’m sorry.” I said as I bonked it on the head with Bonesy.\r\n\r\nThe ghost hit the ground and sort of splattered into dust.\r\n\r\nI sneezed again, then looked around to see if anyone or anything had heard. There was only a new box to greet me.\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have plotted and successfully carried out the homicide of ‘Sentinel Ghost of Threewells by Darkwood’ Level 1! Bonus Exp was granted for killing a monster above your level!\r\n\r\n“No,” I squeaked before my hand slapped across my mouth. “It wasn’t homicide, I swear,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Rrre,” Bonesy accused.\r\n\r\n“No,” I squeaked again.\r\n\r\nLooking down, I noticed a bit of cloth left on the ground, cloth that shimmered lightly. A poke with my foot didn’t do anything except move it about. I carefully picked it up. A loot drop? Inspecting it revealed nothing, but it did shimmer with a certain ethereal quality. I slid it into my haversack and picked my Bonesy stick up again.\r\n\r\nThere were ghosts around, and no telephone to call the Ghostbusters, which left no one but little old me to take care of things.\r\n\r\nI whimpered.');
