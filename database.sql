('\"Young Master\", Type 19', 'Beware of Chicken', 6, 'While a lot of stuff wouldn’t look out of place in ancient china, the exchange was not one of those features. Or at least I thought it looked strange. A building where all the merchants gathered, like some kind of ancient mall? I was expecting a marketplace the last time I came here, not… this.\r\n\r\nBut I guess faster travel in the form of Artifacts, and communication in transmission stones could make something like this possible.\r\n\r\nShaking my head, I went about my business. First, was Tan Gong’s Heavenly Furs. Which was a super fucking pretentious name for a dude who dealt in mortal furs. But it was none of my business. There was a small line of people selling things. Some people got shouted out of the line for poor quality, while some completed their transactions quickly.\r\n\r\nThe man sitting behind the booth and wearing a uniform met me with a frown on his face.\r\n\r\n“Ugh. Another dirt farmer. Yes, yes, boy. Make it quick. I’m sure you think your pelts are worthy to be purchased by our Heavenly Furs company but we have exacting standards–my word!”\r\n\r\nI had, naturally, ignored his speechifying, and bought out the pelts. His eyes bugged out, and he swallowed.\r\n\r\nHey, xianxia tropes are in fine form today. Now hes apologising for being hasty and wringing his hands, and calling me “Good Sir”. I guess this is the part where I should start face slapping him, but I really don’t care.\r\n\r\nWhatever dude, you’re practically drooling over my stuff, you want to buy it or not?\r\n\r\nOf course, I was actually keeping my mouth shut with a small smile on my face, and nodding along appropriately. There was nothing to be gained from insulting some rando dude manning a counter–\r\n\r\nAnd now hes bought his manager out. Who is also calling me Good Sir. And making noises of wanting me to have a contract to supply them.\r\n\r\nI declined as politely as I could, and just sold them the pelts.\r\n\r\n“If you ever have any other furs to sell, please think kindly of our Heavenly Furs company!” The men both said and bowed.\r\n\r\nOf course I’m going to “think kindly” of you, you’re the only gig in town.\r\n\r\nThe man who bought my planks of wood was considerably more polite. An Ren was a good bloke.\r\n\r\nI then went to shop for my own supplies. More sesame oil, sesame seeds, I found a guy with some wheat, which was a major boon. Ah, bread, how I’ve missed you. Wouldn’t be able to plant it now, because fall was going to start soon, but Other than that, a bunch more veggie seeds, some more barrels, and a few more chickens, and a lovely set of cast iron pans.\r\n\r\nI briefly debated getting a pig or a cow, but decided against it for now. Gotta establish the farm a bit better I think.\r\n\r\nI’d probably be meeting up with Meimei soon, so we could go through the last of the herb guides. Today was a good day.\r\n\r\nMy back itched a little bit, as I stepped into the town again. I scratched it absentmindedly.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nMeiling had been having a good day.\r\n\r\nEmphasis on “Had”.\r\n\r\nIt had started out well enough. Jin had some business to take care of, so she had invited Meihua out into the town. They had walked together, arm and arm, and had enjoyed the city together. Meihua had even bought her a lovely new hairpin, and now, they were sitting down to have tea together.\r\n\r\nBut her sister in all but blood uttered foul betrayal.\r\n\r\n“So, when is Jin marrying you?” She asked conversationally, just as Meiling had taken a sip from her tea.\r\n\r\nShe choked as it went down the way, and started coughing.\r\n\r\n“Wha-Uh? Not- Maybe-Nev– Meihua!” She gasped, and her friend laughed merrily, the sound like tinkling chimes.\r\n\r\nShe glared at her friend. “Not you too,” she whined, “I’m getting enough of that from father! We haven’t done anything either, so wipe that knowing look off your face, you vile woman!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you snuck out in the night with him~”\r\n\r\n“Meihua, please.” She begged, her face red.\r\n\r\n“Allright, I’ll stop. All attack, no defense with you. You do like him though, don’t you?”\r\n\r\nShort, brown hair. Vibrant green eyes. That stupid grin.\r\n\r\nHer lips quirked up into an almost smile.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear,” Meihua said, looking at her fondly, “You are smitten, Meimei. Almost as bad as I am for my darling~”\r\n\r\n“Shaddup.” she grumbled, and drained the rest of her tea. Meihua giggled again, but obligingly finished up as well, and needled her no further.\r\n\r\n“Come on, I can’t deal with you anymore,” Meiling said acidly, but Meihua just smiled knowingly, “Lets get you to your darling–”\r\n\r\nThere was an acrid tang on the wind, that was sliding under the smell of earth that she had gotten used to. Blood and Oil. An insidious, slimy thing, full of ill intent.\r\n\r\nQi.\r\n\r\nHer head whipped sound, and she saw the man. Dressed in fine clothes, with two men standing on either side of him. His head started turning in her direction, and she looked away.\r\n\r\n“Meihua. This way.” Meihua noticed her discomfort, and obliged her. They exited the small outdoor seating area swiftly, Meiling practically dragging her friend behind her through an alley on the way to the palace.\r\n\r\n“Meimei, whats going–”\r\n\r\n“Qi. Cultivator. I know you think my nose is off on Jin, but please, trust me on this.”\r\n\r\nMeihua sighed. “All right. But I think you’ve read too many stories. Would someone dare do something like that?”\r\n\r\nMeiling grimaced. And kept walking to the palace.\r\n\r\n“I hope we never find out.”\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\nMeimei was looking off when we met up, all tense angry. I asked her what was wrong, but got a snapped “nothing” and decided to leave it.\r\n\r\nThe next few hours passed in silence, but we didn’t find anything on my root. I wasn’t bothered, and the hours of reading had bled some of the tension out of Meimei’s shoulders.\r\n\r\n“….it wasn’t nothing.”\r\n\r\nI gestured for her to continue.\r\n\r\n“I can smell qi.”\r\n\r\nHuh, so thats how she followed me.\r\n\r\n“…and theres a cultivator in Verdant hill. He smells like oil and blood. He had nasty eyes too.”\r\n\r\nWell, thats not good.\r\n\r\n“I’m probably just being paranoid… but I’m worried about Meihua. Shes in the palace right now, so there should be no problems.. But…”\r\n\r\nWhat? Sure, Meihua was kind of pretty, but some douche just going full young master on her?\r\n\r\nMeimei looked stressed and worried.\r\n\r\n“C’mon” I said, after we put the scrolls back away. “Lets go pick up Meihua and …Tingfeng? We’ll have dinner together.”\r\n\r\n“….Fine.” she muttered, still looking stressed. That wouldn’t do.\r\n\r\n“My Lady Hong Meiling, would you do me the honour of dining with me tonight?”\r\n\r\nHer lips quirked up this time, and she gave me a halfhearted glare.\r\n\r\n“Of course. Jin Rou, I would be honoured to dine with you.” Ouch, I could feel the sarcasm.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t take long to reach the palace. Meihua seemed delighted to see us, and immediately clasped arms with Meimei, while I nodded at Tingfeng.\r\n\r\nWe set off for dinner.\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\n“And then she called me, what was it again? A “wretched, pig-headed shitmonkey?” It was great!”\r\n\r\nI slung my arm around Meimei’s shoulders and pulled her close while Tingfeng howled with laughter. Meimei rammed her elbow ineffectually into my side, so red I thought she might have a stroke.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I remember when she called me a worthless slug sniffing around a lotus flower! She was right, back then, and those words gave me the strength to earn my position, if only to prove her harsh words wrong.”\r\n\r\nTingfeng grinned at Meimei, walking with Meihua arm in arm back to the inn. Meimei had given up trying to escape, and was now just glaring half-heartedly at me.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly froze, and paled. My back itched.\r\n\r\nThree men suddenly appeared in front of us, looking for trouble.\r\n\r\n…were we getting mugged?\r\n\r\nThe leader, in silks, smiled. “I am Zang Li of the Shrouded Mountain sect. You girl, be honoured. I shall allow you to warm my bed tonight.”\r\n\r\nI frowned. Something didn’t feel right.\r\n\r\n“Do his lackeys have qi?” I whispered to Meimei. She sniffed, and nodded. I could feel how tense she was where my hand was on her arm.\r\n\r\n“Not much, compared to you.” she bit back tersely.\r\n\r\nWell, that settled it then. If they had less than me, they were definitely not part of the Shrouded Mountain.\r\n\r\nI took my arm off Meimei.\r\n\r\n“No, she won’t be doing that.” I said simply.\r\n\r\n“You dare oppose the Shrouded Mountain sect?” The cultivator sneered.\r\n\r\nI scoffed. “You aren’t Shrouded Mountain. And I doubt they’ll be happy about you taking their name, buddy.”\r\n\r\nThe cultivator glared, and he snapped his fingers. His buddies drew swords and jumped at me, but hell, even I was more than a match for them. They were certainly slower than that big wolf I brained for Meiling. Poor thing had the mange or something, and it was still better than these guys..\r\n\r\nI gave both of them a good smack, and then started towards fuckboy playing at being a young master. Qi exploded around him.\r\n\r\nI paused, a bit worried at his development.\r\n\r\n“You bastard, you’re courting death–!” He roared.” Behold the technique that slew a cultivator in the profound realm! My ultimate spear!”\r\n\r\n“Heaven Piercing Lance!”\r\n\r\nOh shit he was fast— I didn’t have time to block, and gathered my qi in defense for the first time in months.\r\n\r\nHe hit me in the chest–\r\n\r\nAnd his fingers bent backwards. Like the wrong way backwards.\r\n\r\nHe fell back and started screaming.\r\n\r\nThe fuck?\r\n\r\n….how much of a shitter can you be?!\r\n\r\nI gave him a good smack for being an idiot, then gathered them all up, and took them to jail. Tingfeng came with me.\r\n\r\nI hope I can convince the captain of the guard to just say I was a wandering cultivator. I don’t want any douche nozzles to come try and find me in case he had friends.\r\n\r\n//////\r\n\r\nMeiling stared around the street. Grass and flowers had grown up from around every stone. The trees, preparing for the fall, had all grown blossoms. The wooden buildings closest to the impact point had started growing branches, with tiny leaves poking off them.\r\n\r\n“….Told you my nose hadn’t gone off.” Meiling said, feeling a bit faint.\r\n'),

('A Call to Adventure', 'Cinnamon Bun', 1, '\r\n\r\nI was always the sort of girl that looked for the call to adventure, be it in real life or between the pages of a book. So when my time came, I jumped on it.\r\n\r\nIt all began one fine morning in math class. I was leaning forwards on my desk, elbows down and eyes on the board where our teacher was explaining something about geometric series. It wasn’t my favourite teacher and it was certainly not my favourite subject, but I wanted to keep my grades up all the same. I only had a few months to go before high school was over, and then the whole world was going to open up.\r\n\r\nA low sound rang out. Sort of like a cowbell being dropped from the top of a skyscraper into a fifty-five gallon drum.\r\n\r\nI jumped in my seat and looked around, but all I found were a few students and friends looking at me curiously. I smiled sheepishly and got some grins in return.\r\n\r\nI was about to ask if they had heard the bong noise when it appeared before me. A box, thin and nearly translucent, held in the air by nothing at all and with a simple request on it.\r\n\r\nBong! A great evil has set its root in the world. You are called upon to save it! Do you accept this quest?\r\n\r\nThere were two boxes below that, one labelled ‘I accept’ the other ‘I refuse.’ I tilted my head to the side, the box following the motion, then whipped my head to the other side of the desk only for it to glide back to the centre of my vision.\r\n\r\nI held back a smile. It couldn’t be real.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” I whispered to the girl next to me. “Do you see that?”\r\n\r\nShe followed the direction my finger was pointing and stared at the boy sitting one row ahead. “His hair?” she asked.\r\n\r\nSo, she couldn’t see the floaty prompt box. I waved off her questioning look and refocused on the box. The box that offered me a quest. The box that had appeared with a sound no one else could hear. The box that I suppose no one could see. My grin was so wide my cheeks were hurting.\r\n\r\nI considered what my parents would say, but they were both struck with wanderlust and were the ones responsible for my desire to see the world. They would have been tapping the ‘I accept’ box a million times a second by now.\r\n\r\nGrin firmly in place, I reached out and pressed the ‘I accept’ button.\r\n\r\nDing! The world thanks you for your sacrifice!\r\n\r\nI promptly fell onto my butt.\r\n\r\nThe world had changed in less time than it took to blink. I wasn’t in a sterile classroom anymore with a window overlooking a snowy courtyard or surrounded by about twenty other bored students. No desks, no chairs, no low rumble of distant cars and air exchange systems. Instead, there was birdsong and the croaking of frogs and the gentle murmur of wind through trees.\r\n\r\nI hopped to my feet and looked around. I was in a room still. Most of a room. An ex-room. The floor was paved with large flat stones slotted into each other, and the walls were made of a slightly different kind of stone with thick wooden beams running up to the ceiling above.\r\n\r\nTables that had rotted away were left lying around next to crushed chairs and piles of mulch that might have been leaves once. The entire room stank of mold and rot. It reminded me of camping out in the woods when I was a little younger.\r\n\r\nMost of one wall was entirely missing.\r\n\r\n“Whoa,” I said as I moved as close to the edge as I dared.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately obvious that I was in a tower of some sort, one that rose a level or two above the treeline of the forest beyond. Trees stretched out as far as the eye could see, a sea of swaying green treetops that rose and fell with the dip and rises of the landscape. In the distance was a grey blur that might have been a mountain range that swept into the horizon.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t see any lakes or rivers, but could hear the nearby gurgle of water splashing against stones. Maybe the tower’s other side was against the ocean or a river or something. I couldn’t tell, and in that moment it didn’t matter.\r\n\r\nThe giddiness rose up in my tummy like an overflowing well, and it burst out as a happy giggle.\r\n\r\n“Yes! Yes! Yes!” I shouted to the heavens as I started jumping around the room, arms waving in the air with every cheer. “I made it! I get adventures and dragons and princesses!”\r\n\r\nI ran in little circles while giggling and might have boogied down a little, shaking my hips as happy energy coursed through my veins.\r\n\r\n“Woo! This is going to be awesome!” My scream sent birds flying into the air all in a flutter.\r\n\r\nA bell sounded, light and tinkling, like crystal chimes being struck together.\r\n\r\nDing! For Completing a Special Action while Devoid of Classes, you have unlocked a new Class!\r\n\r\nMy breathing hitched, but if anything the core of excitement in my gut only grew bigger. “A class,” I whispered.\r\n\r\nDing! You are now a Cinnamon Bun!\r\nHealth + 5\r\nStamina +10\r\nMana +5\r\nResilience +10\r\nFlexibility +10\r\nMagic +5\r\n\r\n“Really?” I asked the prompt, but its only response was to fade away.\r\n\r\nThe tropes and stereotypes of a game weren’t new to me, of course, but I had never heard of a class called Cinnamon Bun. I had eaten some of those before, in fact, and they certainly didn’t taste like something someone could be. But maybe this world was different. I hoped that this world was different.\r\n\r\nWith dragons and elves and monsters of all sorts! I would be able to grow strong and tough and I’d meet a dragon and ride it into battle and maybe have tea with some dwarves and I was getting ahead of myself...\r\n\r\nThere was usually some menu or status page in the books that I’d read. And so thinking, my mind was flooded with information. Not very much, but some facts and figures and a sort of... memory of a screen. “Whoa.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Name 	Broccoli Bunch 	 \r\n  	Race 	Human 	 \r\n  	First Class 	Cinnamon Bun 	 \r\n  	First Class Level 	0 	 \r\n  	Age 	16 	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Health 	105\r\n	 \r\n  	Stamina    110\r\n	 \r\n  	Mana       105\r\n	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Resilience   15\r\n	 \r\n  	Flexibility 15\r\n	 \r\n  	Magic       10\r\n	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Skills 	Rank N/A 	  	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n\r\n\r\n“So cool!” This, of course, prompted more happy dancing. I had a class and an empty skills list and a bunch of numbers that meant more than anything I had worked on in maths class. Also, Magic.\r\n\r\nI didn’t know what some of them meant, but it didn’t matter! I had them and they were mine! A bit of a push and the box with my status and all appeared before my very eyes. I hugged it.\r\n\r\nOr, well, I tried to hug it. The box kept juking out of hug reach, even when I started laughing and skipping after it. It was a good box and good boxes deserved all the hugs. Then, with a soap-bubble like pop, the box disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Okay, okay, Broc, calm yourself,” I said between still escaping giggles. A few deep breaths helped to chill me out. I wanted to sit down, to inspect my super cool new stats and maybe to skip some more because I felt brilliant.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the tower’s floor was a mess. Tables ruined, chairs, all save for one rickety thing in the corner, all busted up. There was a shovel with a flat head leaning against one wall though, and an ancient broom with bristles made from some plant or another.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to have a rest, this wasn’t the place for it, not unless I cleaned it up a little.\r\n\r\nThe only exit to the room was behind a stack of fallen stones, each one looking as if they weighed as much as I did.\r\n\r\nI pulled up the only seat that looked able to take my weight, then wiped its surface clean.\r\n\r\nDing! For doing a Special Action in line with your Class, you have unlocked the skill: Cleaning!\r\n\r\nI laughed. A skill! A silly, rather boring skill, but maybe one that would help. It would help even more if I grinded a little, and I did like cleaning.\r\n\r\nNodding to myself, I picked up the broom and shovel and got to work. First making sure that the ground below the opening in the wall was clear of anyone or anything, then I started shovelling up the dead leaves and pushing them out.\r\n\r\nA bit of grunting and some sweating had the broken tables busted up even more and stacked up neatly off to one side. The moldier bits I tossed out. Maybe I would have to build a fire later. Not that I had a lighter or matches, but I could make do.\r\n\r\nThen came the sweeping. I swiped at the cobwebs in the corners, swept the floor clean and even dusted off the one usable chair I found.\r\n\r\nEvery so often I felt a whisper of a ‘ding’ in the back of my mind, like a distant noise that was just barely audible. A quick bit of focusing revealed that it was my Cleaning skill rising up, and quickly at that.\r\n\r\nProbably because of its low level, I decided.\r\n\r\nSoon enough the room was as clean as it would be. The mold brushed off the walls with more enthusiasm than skill, the floors swept, the broken furniture sorted and a small table and chair arranged to one side where I could sit down and relax.\r\n\r\nI sighed as I flopped onto my seat, the old wood creaking under my weight but not breaking. “Classes!” I decided. That’s where I would start.\r\n\r\nFirst Class: Cinnamon Bun\r\nLevel 0\r\nYou are the Cinnamon Bun. Too good for this world. Too pure. You are the perfect support and friend to all. Nature itself smiles upon you.\r\nCleanse this world of its impurities in the name of love and justice!\r\n\r\nI snorted. That wasn’t the most helpful description I’d ever seen. Too pure? Well, that... okay, so maybe I was a little naive, sometimes, all of my friends said so, and everyone was my friend. But the Class description didn’t have to be so smug about it. Also, First Class, which meant that I could maybe unlock a second at some point. Dragon Rider class, here I come!\r\n\r\nThe Cleaning skill sort of made sense if it was tied to some sort of class ability to cleanse things.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was a class that was good against the undead? I certainly hoped so! Seeing a walking skeleton would be creepy. Unless it was a nice gentlemanly skeleton, in which case that was alright.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t okay to mock or judge others because of their appearance after all.\r\n\r\nHumming to myself, I focused on my Cleaning Skill instead.\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank F - 90%\r\nThe ability to clean. As this skill rises in level your ability to Clean will improve!\r\n\r\n“Well, okay.” That was utterly underwhelming. Still, maybe as I got better at it I would be able to keep myself and the world around me clean too! It was worth it!\r\n\r\nI stretched in my new seat then hopped off. It wasn’t time for sitting back and relaxing. It was time to do stuff! First I had a bunch of things to test out!\r\n\r\nTrying to figure out if I had an inventory of some sort was fruitless. No amount of shouting ‘inventory!’ amounted to anything. Then I looked for a handy help menu, but that was absent too. But, after much searching and some head scratching, I found something incredible.\r\n\r\nYou have one (1) Active Quest:\r\nThe Hole Down Under\r\nAn evil root has plunged into the world. Find it. Remove it.\r\n\r\nThat was it. No waypoints, no hints. Not even a handy-dandy list of rewards. I huffed at the quest box and that was apparently its hint that it wasn’t needed anymore. What even was an evil root?\r\n\r\nWell, that didn’t matter. Maybe it was the sort of quest that would take a long, long time to accomplish. I didn’t have that luxury. The sum total of my belongings amounted to a pretty blouse I had bought on sale a week ago, a sturdy pair of shoes I liked, a thick cotton skirt that reached to just below the knees and some warm stockings. And of course my underthings.\r\n\r\nNot even a jacket.\r\n\r\nFortunately it was warm wherever I was. So no need for too much warm clothing. Though a blanket would have been nice. Or a towel.\r\n\r\nI had failed hitchhiking one-oh-one already.\r\n\r\nShrugging to myself, I moved to the edge of the hole in the wall and looked down. Two stories from my little nook to the ground, at least judging by the number of windows. The floors looked rather tall. Or maybe that was my newly discovered fear of falling to my death that was talking.\r\n\r\nA look over to the blocked doorway confirmed that there was no way I was moving the stones there.\r\n\r\nNo ropes, no safety equipment, no easy way down.\r\n\r\nAt least the rocky walls of the tower were rough and had plenty of handholds. It might be possible, easy even, to climb down.\r\n\r\nFirming up my resolve, I prepared myself to climb over the edge. My first step into a wild new world!\r\n'),
('A Look into the Past', 'Cinnamon Bun', 9, '\r\n\r\nI stayed up late to read.

Felt them myself. Worried someone might have damaged the dungeon core. Guard rotation C spotted someone in the forests in green. Imperials? This far out? It could explain the shifts in local mana. Doubled the guards just in case. Sent a scout to the Dunwich Dungeon.\r\n-Overseer Hardy\r\n\r\nThings were getting interesting, very interesting. A dungeon sounded like a neat place to visit, and there was a lot of talk here about mana as if it was a thing that was just... in the air. I wondered if the mana here was thick or thin and if I would be able to tell the difference.\r\n\r\nReport, Ninth of Harvest\r\nDunwich dungeon was destroyed. The shifts in mana are the ley lines snapping apart. Spoke to the mayor. She doesn’t want to evacuate but we have no choice, not with Imperials so close and the mana turning like this. No news of the adventuring team sent out. Still have their bard in a cell. Will release him later.\r\nMore imperial sightings. Hopefully they’ll let a group of civilians pass unharmed.\r\n-Overseer Hardy\r\n\r\nAnd that was it. No more reports, just a few blank pages. So there were ley lines for magic. And Bonesy the Bard had been part of an adventuring group. That was kind of neat! Good on him. Not so good was how he had caused trouble at the Inn. He was just as poorly behaved in life as he was in death.\r\n\r\nDing! For repeating a Special Action a sufficient number of times you have unlocked the skill: Archaeology!\r\n\r\nI smiled and blew out the candle, then shifted until sleep took me at long last.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI woke up feeling refreshed. Not at my best, and my tummy still rumbled for food that wasn’t honey, but the pall of depression was lifted and I felt my face twisting back into my usual smile. Then I unleashed a blast of cleaning magic at myself and shivered as mana coursed over my body and clothes. It was like taking a shower but better.\r\n\r\nStanding up, I stretched, ran through an abridged version of my morning routine (I’d give all of my silver for a toothbrush and paste) then stepped outside after making sure the coast was clear of ghosts.\r\n\r\nToday was the day I would take on the wraith. But first, I had a church to explore and a sickly sweet breakfast to lick.\r\n\r\nI strolled across the ghost town, spoon in mouth and attention swivelling around to take in everything. Things had changed in the two short days I had been here. There had been grass when I first came out, but it was brown and feeble and kind of sad. Now bushes were sprouting up everywhere and the grass was thick and lush and vibrant. The entire world seemed more alive, somehow.\r\n\r\nWas it because there were fewer ghosts?\r\n\r\nI couldn’t believe that level one monsters were that strong. But then again, the ghosts couldn’t be hurt through normal means. Maybe the animals and such were careful and cautious around them--proving once more than the average animal was smarter than little old me.\r\n\r\nThe church was a stately building, even with fresh vines climbing up its sides and huge holes poked through its stained glass windows. It looked like the kind of place that local weddings would be held in, and where a nice old priest would try to help people with their problems and all the old ladies would gather to trade the juiciest gossip.\r\n\r\nThere was a sense of lost serenity around the building, a sensation that took me a long time to name and would take longer to get used to. It would have felt wrong to scream and shout or fight.\r\n\r\nI pushed open the front door and slid into the main hall. It was a single large room with rows of wooden benches all facing a trio of stone altars. Dust swirled in the air and the light, most of it pouring through the mosaic windows, coloured the entire room in a spectrum of soft blues and greens and reds.\r\n\r\n“Hello?” I asked as I moved in. Only silence greeted me. I moved through the room, careful to be as quiet and respectful as I could until I was at the altars. They were all different. Did they practice one faith with many gods here, or were there many religions housed in one church?\r\n\r\nThe first altar had a small stone chalice built into it, with stone grapes and fruit around its base. The second had a carving of an arm holding an axe engraved atop it and the third had a statue of an archway reaching from one side to the other.\r\n\r\nStrange, disparate symbols with meanings I could only guess at. Most buried under a layer of dust. Three quick flashes of magic cleared the altars, leaving them as the only untouched things in the entire room. A strange dichotomy, maybe.\r\n\r\nI bowed to the three altars and moved on. There was nothing for me here.\r\n\r\nAccording to my map I still had five houses to explore, but I doubted I would find anything incredible there. No, my goal at that moment was to face the wraith and inspect the hole. I could return to exploring at any time after that.\r\n\r\nThe monster was hovering over the opened pit, twisting and turning and writhing in the air as if it was wracked with pain. Pain that it almost seemed to enjoy. Now that I was closer I could hear its delighted howls, the almost ecstatic moans that it made as jolts of... something coursed through it.\r\n\r\nWhatever the wraith was feeding on came from the hole. Evil mana, maybe? I could only guess.\r\n\r\nMy backpack was left on the doorstep of a nearby home. I took a moment to go over my plan, as simple as it was. I was going to go out and attack the wraith, first with the showerhead-flail I had, then by throwing my magic wand through it. Then, if it was sufficiently distracted, I would use my cleaning spell on it.\r\n\r\nIf things went well that would be enough to clear it out.\r\n\r\nThe very first step though, of course, was to talk to it.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was a nice evil wraith? “Insight.”\r\n\r\nAn evil wraith, level 2.\r\n\r\nMaybe not. But I wouldn’t hit someone in the back without at least trying to talk first. Anything else would just be wrong.\r\n\r\nI sat back and ate another spoonful of honey as I looked over my many skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Name 	Broccoli Bunch 	 \r\n  	Race 	Human 	 \r\n  	First Class 	Cinnamon Bun 	 \r\n  	First Class Level 	1 	 \r\n  	Age 	16 	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Health 	\r\n105​\r\n	 \r\n  	Stamina 	\r\n115​\r\n	 \r\n  	Mana 	\r\n105​\r\n	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Resilience 	\r\n15​\r\n	 \r\n  	Flexibility 	\r\n20​\r\n	 \r\n  	Magic 	\r\n10​\r\n	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	Skills 	Rank 	 \r\n  	Cinnamon Bun Skills 	  	 \r\n  	Cleaning 	C - 14% 	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n  	General Skills 	  	 \r\n  	Insight 	E - 97% 	 \r\n  	Makeshift Weapon Proficiency 	F - 42% 	 \r\n  	Archeology 	F - 15% 	 \r\n  	  	  	 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was quite the warrior it seemed. “Soon,” I whispered in the deepest darkest voice I could manage. It came out squeaky, but it was the thought that counted! “Everyone across all the realms will learn to respect the might of Broccoli the great Cinnamon Bun!”\r\n\r\nI might have been able to get Insight up another level, but that didn’t feel necessary, or even helpful in a fight. Makeshift weapons would have been a good skill to level, but I wasn’t sure how to do that except to fight some more, and there wasn’t anything left to fight that I had seen so far.\r\n\r\nWell, ghosts didn’t generally move very fast. I would try against this one and see how things worked out. Worse case, I was an excellent runner.\r\n\r\nI stepped out into the morning sunlight, makeshift flail hanging by my side, mana topped off at max and a determined frown on my face. I walked over to the evil well of evilness until I was only a few dozen paces away. “Hello!” I called out.\r\n\r\nThe wraith paused in its weird wriggling and turned.\r\n\r\nMy blood ran cold.\r\n\r\nThe wraith screamed.\r\n\r\nYou have heard the screech of a fearsome creature! Your soul is shaken.\r\n\r\nMy breathing hitched and I had a sudden urge to run to the nearest bathroom as the monster tore through the sky towards me. Its hands stretched and shifted, turning into long, scythe-like claws.\r\n\r\nI snapped out of it just in time to hop backwards and narrowly avoid the first swing. The wraith screamed again, but this time I was a little more ready for it and managed not to pee my skirts. Instead I flung my showerhead flail at the monster and almost fainted when it bounced off its face.\r\n\r\nThe wraith flinched back, face leaking the same plumes of dust the ghosts had, though in far smaller quantities.\r\n\r\nIt spun around and charged at me again.\r\n\r\nI rolled out of its path, then tossed the magic wand that merely booped its chest and left only the tiniest of wounds.\r\n\r\nNot enough, not nearly enough.\r\n\r\nI started spinning the flail around and around until it hummed through the air. The wraith came at me again, its one track mind not terribly suited to thinking, it seemed. My flail crashed into its hand, a spark of magic burst from the impact, the wraith screeched, though now in pain rather than anger.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” I said as I lunged closer to it and pressed a hand against its chest. “Clean!”\r\n\r\nMy mana dropped, then dropped faster as I poured more and more into the attempt to cleanse the monster. A patch formed around my hand, slowly growing and spreading across its body. First a few centimeters, then a few more in an expanding circle.\r\n\r\nMy mana hit zero.\r\n\r\nThe world shifted, the corners of my vision going blurry as I stumbled back and fell onto my bum.\r\n\r\nThe wraith was twisting and screeching, its one remaining clawed arm trying to push back all of its dusty stuff into the massive tear in its chest. It gave up after a moment and started to move towards the hole. Slower now, much slower than its earlier charge.\r\n\r\nThis was my chance, my opportunity to run back and regroup, to figure out a new strategy and maybe let my mana return to full.\r\n\r\nI stumbled to my feet and ran after the wraith, for a certain definition of ‘ran.’ My stumbling gait didn’t stop me from spinning my flail again, and when the ghostly monster started to suck at the evil mana it left itself wide open.\r\n\r\nThe flail rammed into and through its body, cutting off its lower half to let it float down and turn to so much dust.\r\n\r\nIt spun around, the back of its claws raking across my face and chest and sending me flying a few feet. “Ouch,” I said as I landed on my back. I wanted to stay there for a moment, but huge claws spearing down at me were enough encouragement that I rolled to the side. Just in time, too, as the talons dug into the ground where I had been.\r\n\r\nAnother smack of the flail, weaker this time and from an awkward angle, was enough to push its hands away. My mana was back to one. One mana.\r\n\r\nI slapped my hand on its screeching face and fired off my cleaning spell. It was little more than a short lived burst, but that was enough to make it race backwards and give me some room. I scrambled back, then got to my feet.\r\n\r\n“You are a big, fat meaniehead!” I taunted the monster.\r\n\r\nIt kind of just stared at me angrily. I was going to need to learn the taunt skill one of these days, if that was even a thing.\r\n\r\nAnother spin of my flail ended with the shower head smacking the now weakened wraith again, and again, and again.\r\n\r\nThe fight didn’t end in a glorious moment of triumph, but in a constant beatdown, where I delivered blow after blow to an enemy that was less and less capable of fighting back until, finally...\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have laid ‘The Wraith of Threewells by Darkwood’ Level 2! To rest! Bonus Exp was granted for savaging a monster above your level!\r\n\r\n'),
('An Insightful Afternoon', 'Cinnamon Bun', 6, 'Cleaning\r\nRank D - 44%\r\n\r\nI grinned at the results, wiped my forehead dry of sweat and stretched until my back pop-popped in a most satisfactory way. The sun was starting to dip already. It was crazy how much fun you could have just exploring.\r\n\r\nSo far, I had covered two of the houses next to the Inn, both of them much bigger than the homes on the Inn’s other side. They had enough bedrooms and space for big families, and the quality of the furniture was much better. I even managed to find better brooms and a mop that looked almost brand new and that seemed to stay fresh no matter how much I used it.\r\n\r\nA magic mop! Or one that was just really well made.\r\n\r\nI had three more homes to work on in this corner of the town--the section that I suspected was reserved for the richer inhabitants--then I would move all the way to the other end in the poorer section where I could see the peaked roof of a church.\r\n\r\nNodding to myself, I stepped out of the last house, Bonesy in my wash bucket and my mop and broom slung over my shoulder.\r\n\r\nI should have been paying more attention.\r\n\r\nA white hand clawed out towards my face and I squeaked as I bent over backwards to avoid the swipe aimed right at me.\r\n\r\nI fell on my bum, then rolled to the side as a claw raked through the ground where I had fallen. My hand shot out and I grabbed Bonesy, swinging the head around to slice through the next swipe aiming for my face.\r\n\r\nIt worked, making the ghostly hand vanish for a moment before it reformed. It was a big enough window of time that I was able to roll again, then climb onto my feet. My skirt and blouse was soggy where they had rolled in the grass and my hair had gone wild, but that was secondary to the ghost that turned and tried to claw at me again.\r\n\r\n“Not this time, buster,” I said as I swiped Bonesy through one arm, then the other, then with a yell that was totally not a squeak, I swished the skeletal head through the ghost from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nI panted as the ghost faded away to nothing, leaving only a glowing dust behind that soon sparkled away into darkness. “Oh my goshness,” I said as I tried to calm my beating heart. I looked this way and that, taking in the homes all around me and inspecting everything.\r\n\r\nThat had been close. Way too close. And so easy to avoid too. All I had to do was stick my head out of the door and look around and I would have been fine. This wasn’t home--I had to remind myself--where things weren’t out to kill you all day every day.\r\n\r\nMy grip around bonesy tightened and I shivered.\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have made ‘Sentinel Ghost of Threewells by Darkwood’ Level 1 come to a sticky end!\r\n\r\nI stared at the prompt. “Was that a stick pun?” I asked.\r\n\r\nClearly the menu systems in this world were all quite evil. It was something to take my mind off my latest near-death experience... and now I was the one making puns. I groaned and looked up to the sky, taking in the huge blue expanse with the occasional distant birds and the strange balloon in the dista--\r\n\r\nI blinked and focused on what looked like a tiny--or very, very distant--oblong balloon. It was brown-ish grey, with a large red mark on its side and a faint trail of smoke behind it. Not something organic, not with the way it hung motionless in the sky.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” I wondered.\r\n\r\nDing! For repeating a Special Action a sufficient number of times you have unlocked the general skill: Insight!\r\n\r\n“Holy moly!” I looked around. I hadn’t forgotten the whole ghost almost-eating-my-face thing, but this was certainly a nice distraction. “Insight!” I said as I held up Bonesy\r\n\r\nA Skeleton (Level ?) head attached to a stick.\r\n\r\nI laughed, then pressed a hand over my mouth to keep the sound low. Looking up, I stared at the tiny distant shape and thought ‘insight’ as hard as I could.\r\n\r\nAn airship.\r\n\r\n“A flip fluffering airship?” I gasped.\r\n\r\nThere were magical airships around! The world had just gotten a million times cooler. But those were things I’d never get to see if I stayed in this ghost-town...\r\n\r\n“Oh no, the puns are catching up.”\r\n\r\nI shook my head, picked up all of my gear, and moved on to the next house. This one’s front door was locked, but the window was completely smashed in. It was pretty easy to climb in then unlock the door from the inside.\r\n\r\nThere were some bits of furniture left in this house, more so than in others. I made the rounds, checking the kitchen for anything good, then the pantry and the single bedroom and bathroom on the first floor. Nothing. I did find a strange room on the second floor, with large training dummies that were sad and squashed looking where the straw stuffing that had once filled them was rotten away and a rack with some rusty short swords on it. They were probably cheap even before time took its toll. Still, I replaced my fire poker and counted myself lucky.\r\n\r\nIn the next room over, this one an office with a broken window that had let the elements slip in, I found a small dent atop a desk where the dust was sitting strangely. A bit of poking revealed a hidden compartment, but it only held a silvery key and a bit of ribbon that had rotted away. I tucked it in my sack and kept searching, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nOnce I was done with the top floor I began grinding.\r\n\r\n“Insight.”\r\n\r\nA training dummy.\r\n\r\n“Insight!”\r\n\r\nA sword.\r\n\r\n“Insight?”\r\n\r\nA practice pole.\r\n\r\nSo, Insight wasn’t that useful, at least not at this level. That just meant I now had two skills I could grind! Insight seemed to be increasing by a percentage point with every item I used it on, which was simple enough. But I didn\'t want to leave my cleaning fall behind.\r\n\r\nAn hour or so later I carefully, with much snooping around and down and up, moved out of the house and called it done.\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank D - 68%\r\n\r\nInsight\r\nRank F - 89%\r\n\r\nGrinning, I moved onto the next home, then the next. Halfway through the first home a big ‘ding’ resounded in the back of my head and I jumped for joy and spun around with my broom.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Through repeated actions your Insight skill has improved and is now eligible for rank up!\r\nRank E is a free rank!\r\n\r\n“Woo!” I cheered as I bounced on the spot, only stopping when my broom handle banged on the ceiling and sent a wave of dust clattering down onto my head. I coughed and choked and sputtered and basically lost a lot of the good cheer I’d just garnered.\r\n\r\nI accepted the rank up and checked out my crazy new skill.\r\n\r\nInsight\r\nRank E - 00%\r\nThe Ability to know something. The knowledge you gain is increased.\r\n\r\n“Wow!” I said before focusing on Bonesy who was sitting in a corner to watch me clean.\r\n\r\nA Skeleton (Level ?) head poorly attached to a stick.\r\n\r\n“That was... underwhelming.” None of the other things I used Insight on revealed much more than what they were with a single word descriptor of their quality or age. I sort of already know that my short sword was rusty. But that was just rank E! Maybe I’d become a real Sherlock Holmes when I hit rank SS+!\r\n\r\nMy cleaning continued, my skills at housecleaning in a dead city improving to the point where I could clean a whole house in just under an hour or so. I guessed. I would need a watch at some point.\r\n\r\nIf watches existed.\r\n\r\nBut airships did, so why not?\r\n\r\nI took what little stuff I had found that was useful. A nice silver candle holder with a mirrored hand protector that would keep the light out of the holder’s eyes, a pretty painting of a boat on a river with a dragon flying in the background in a nice frame, a few spoons and table knives made of silver, and tossed them all into a rough sack I found that was hole-less. They were the sum total of my riches.\r\n\r\nWhen I found civilization my first stop was going to be an antique’s store where I could sell all of the stuff and make enough to fund any future adventures!\r\n\r\nI pulled out my map and checked it out. It seemed that I had cleaned and explored the--I was going to call it Western--part of the town completely. The Evil Hole of Great Evil was just to the East of where I was, which was totally off limits because I was pretty sure the only respawn I would get was as a ghost to haunt the next poor adventurer and that wasn’t neat.\r\n\r\nMore grinding!\r\n\r\nI had to admit, cleaning had never been so much fun. Or grinding for that matter. There were real, tangible benefits to all of this and I loved every moment of it except for the moments where I was nearly dying. Those I could do without.\r\n\r\nI arrived at the southern end of the town and realized that I would need to update my map a lot. But before that, more sneaking!\r\n\r\nMoving between two homes, I kept myself low to the ground, my haversack and cleaning gear and things left next to a house behind to reduce the noise I made as I moved around.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that at some point the road leading into the town forked and never reconnected, so that the road I had been exploring for the past day and a bit was disconnected from the one I found now. This road ended at a big gate that was left ajar, just enough for someone to walk through if it wasn’t for the huge pile of branches stuffed by the entrance.\r\n\r\nThere was another well, which made three! I was right about the name!\r\n\r\nMy silent cheering at my discovery froze up when I peeked around a corner and found the old church I had seen a while ago. It was a large building with two bell towers and a small graveyard behind it. One filled with ghosts. A quick snoop revealed five glowing forms wandering in circles.\r\n\r\nFive too many.\r\n\r\nI still snooped around a little. The buildings nearest the church looked like businesses. A blacksmith’s shop, a supply store of some kind, a shop with a stick-like symbol before it. I took note of what I could see, then backed away.\r\n\r\nToo much for me to handle at my level.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was best that I just... move on. But then that would leave my quest undone, and something niggled at me about it. It didn’t have a timer, exactly, but I could tell that the longer I waited the harder things would get.\r\n\r\nNo. It was best that I stick around and at least try to see what I could do. There was another tower to visit at the far end of town. Close to the evil ghost but not on it. And there were ghosts that I might be able to chat with.\r\n\r\nAnd of course more stuff to explore.\r\n\r\nI entered a house as far from the church as could be and did my usual snoop and clean routine. Then, nearly an hour later, as the sun was setting, I used the last rays to update my map, scrubbing out mistakes with some spit and rubbing, and checked on my skill growth.\r\n\r\nInsight\r\nRank E - 14%\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank D - 84%\r\n\r\nCome morning I would hit Cleaning rank C and probably Insight rank D. Two handy skills to have, but neither combat based. Still, I wasn’t without options. I would try to lure some ghosts closer to me and take them out with Bonesy. Insight had come from repetitive actions. Cleaning from a smaller number of actions, but it was a ‘class’ skill.\r\n\r\nCinnamon Bun was obviously not a combat class, so for a fighting skill I would need a whole lot more repetitions.\r\n\r\nI could do it, I knew I could!\r\n\r\n“I believe in me!” I said.\r\n\r\n“Rrrr,” Bonsey agreed. And with that, I packed up and snuck back to the spot I’d slept in the night prior.\r\n');
INSERT INTO `capitulo` (`Chapter_ID`, `Book ID`, `Chapter Num`, `Texto`) VALUES
('Armoured and Ready', 'Cinnamon Bun', 7, '\r\n\r\nI was feeling off as I sat down at a quiet table, Bonesy propped up across from me with a spoon crunching in their mouth.\r\n\r\nThere was a spoon in my own mouth, metal clinking against my teeth and I wiggled it around and let the lingering taste of honey fade away. It took some thinking, some soul-searching, to figure out exactly what it was that bothered me.\r\n\r\nI was lonely.\r\n\r\nMy entire life had been filled with people. Friends and family and new faces that were just waiting for me to make them smile. We had moved a lot throughout my life, so I was used to parting with friends and making new ones all the time. That had to be it. This town was quiet, no one to talk to, no one to share with.\r\n\r\nBut that would change! I would accomplish my mission, the very reason I was here, then I would move on and find people. Maybe buy an airship and become sky pirate Broccoli! But without the piracy because taking other people’s stuff without permission wasn’t nice.\r\n\r\nNodding, I wiped my spoon clean, tossed it into my sack, then got things ready for a whole new day of adventuring. The sun was just starting to peak over the horizon, which meant I had all day.\r\n\r\nHopefully, by the end of the day I would be done exploring the city. Maybe I would even be strong enough to face the Evil Hole in earnest.\r\n\r\nWe’d see.\r\n\r\nFor now the plan was simple. Explore every house next to the ‘south’ wall as best I could, then move over to the shops. Something told me that I would find some much nicer loot there. Then... then I would need to find a way to get rid of all those ghosts near the church.\r\n\r\nI would try talking to them first, but if that didn’t work, then maybe I could rig up a sort of trap? I was certain there were other magical items around that I could use to injure them. Flicking magic stuff at my adversaries until they poofed wasn’t the most glorious tactic, but it might work.\r\n\r\nAll my gear was prepped, Bonesy ‘Rrr’ed’ in readiness, and I was determined to make the best of the day.\r\n\r\nThe first home I scouted was across the street from the inn at an angle. A long, low house with a roof that had once been a vibrant green before decades of missing maintenance took their toll. The door was locked, but a kick solved that problem and opened it right up.\r\n\r\nIt was dusty and a little tarnished within, but nothing I hadn’t seen, or cleaned, before. Surprisingly there was only a small fireplace tucked in a corner. No kitchen proper. The place felt unlived in. The furniture pushed to the sides, the bedroom too large for the single bed shoved up against the far wall. The bookshelf empty of any interesting looking bindings but filled with broken knick knacks.\r\n\r\nAn ancient jug. Empty\r\n\r\nI rolled my eyes, dusted the jug and moved on.\r\n\r\nThe next room was a big office, one with surprisingly few papers, but they were in good shape. There was a huge ledger-like book on the table, one that was entirely untouched by dust or grime and looked as if it had just come off the printing press. I fired an Insight at it.\r\n\r\nLedger and Accounts of the Well Inn Good, soul bound book\r\n\r\nSoul bound? That was disturbing. Taking a moment to make sure I was alone, I moved to the big book and poked it. Nothing. Then I fished out a spoon and tried to open the book.\r\n\r\nWarning! This book is Soul Bound!\r\nWarning! The Soul Binding on this book has faded. The previous owner has passed away.\r\nDo you wish to Bind your Soul to this book? Ledger and Accounts of the Well Inn Good.\r\n\r\nDid I want to play with strange and unknown magics that messed with my soul without any idea of what they did? “Nope,” I said.\r\n\r\nI dusted around the book, and over and under the desk. There was a rusty key in a drawer. I held it up and stared at it for a moment. If the book was the Inn’s ledger, than this key might be for the basement I couldn’t get into.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t cost anything to check! Then I remembered that I was an idiot and didn’t have to travel all the way over to the inn for that. “Insight.”\r\n\r\nWell Inn Good Basement Key.\r\n\r\n“Neat,” I said before tossing the key into my sack and moving on. The next house was entirely empty. Not even any furniture left behind. I didn’t get much experience in that one. The one right after wasn’t a house at all, but a sort of storage place.\r\n\r\nThe door was barred with a heavy gate that I couldn’t break through, and the windows were... well, there weren’t any. I pouted at the building, but that didn’t do anything. So I marked it on my map and moved on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next two homes were small and simple, but I could see the church through the windows, so I cleared them with as much stealth as possible. It was worth it though as I found some coins under a mattress in what might have been a sock once. One silver, some green disks that were either copper or bronze.\r\n\r\nIn the second house I found a magical device under one bed.\r\n\r\nCheap magical wand, old\r\n\r\nAll it did when I pushed magic into it was vibrate. Maybe I could use it to hurt ghosts though, so I tossed it into my sack.\r\n\r\nThen it finally happened.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Through repeated actions your Cleaning skill has improved and is now eligible for rank up!\r\nRank C costs one (1) Class Point\r\n\r\n“What?!” I said once I was done cheering (quietly). I did have a Class Point from when I levelled up, but I was loath to spend it so soon. Wasn’t I supposed to sit on skill points forever and never ever use them until I had to fight some big boss?\r\n\r\nOh well, whatever. A lost point at level one wasn’t that big a deal, I figured.\r\n\r\nSpend one (1) Class Point to raise the Rank of Cleaning to C?\r\n\r\n“Yes please,” I said.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! Cleaning is now Rank C!\r\n\r\nCleaning\r\nRank C - 00%\r\nThe ability to Clean. You are exceptionally good at tidying up and washing off. Effectiveness of cleaning is marginally increased. You may now use mana to clean things you touch.\r\n\r\nI stared, then started to giggle, and then, because I didn’t want the ghosts across the street to eat me, I slapped a hand over my mouth and ran out of the house.\r\n\r\nMy next stop was somewhere I was curious about, and where I could practice my new magic. Magic! I had magic! I didn’t so much run as skip to the Inn.\r\n\r\nThe Inn was how I had left it, deserted but surprisingly clean, like a house in bad need of some love ready to be shown off to some prospective buyers. I twirled around, skirt flaring for a moment before I refocused on my task. A bit of searching later, I had the basement key in hand and was fitting it into the lock.\r\n\r\nThe door opened with a deep groan, revealing a long room with a low ceiling. There were stones with glyphs on them fixed to the beams above, a long table in the middle of the room with a few scraps of what might have been a map, and some crates stacked up to one side. The far wall had big kegs that had probably held the wine and mead and beer that they once served here.\r\n\r\nNo ghosts, wraiths or even a rodent of unusual size.\r\n\r\nI was in the clear to explore.\r\n\r\nDeeper in, I found three stands with armour on them, each rack covered in roughly scratched glyphs. The armour looked intact as if they had been completely untouched by the passing of time.\r\n\r\nI gasped, already giddy at the idea of using magic, now doubly so if I got to wear cool armour while casting my first spells.\r\n\r\nThe first two sets looked like something I’d expect a lowly adventurer to wear.\r\n\r\nSimple steel armour, old.\r\n\r\nSimple steel plate armour, old.\r\n\r\nThey were neat, but built for someone way bigger than me. And male. The third set was more to my liking.\r\n\r\nSimple armless gambeson, old.\r\n\r\nThe thick padded cloth, all of it coloured a sort of beige, would make me look kind of chubby, that that was alright if it meant not being dead. It even had a sort of jacket above it made of a thick leather. A skirt made of long strips of leather with little brozen scales sewn into it hung below.\r\n\r\nBoiled leather jacket, old.\r\n\r\nBoiled leather skirt, old.\r\n\r\nA glance at the racks and a quick ‘Insight’ revealed how they had survived so long.\r\n\r\nMagical armour rack.\r\n\r\nI took the armour off the rack and weighted it in my arms for a bit. It was all a little heavier than my usual clothes, but that was fine. “It’s such a shame there’s no way for me to clean this poor, dirty old armour with a spell,” I said with false exasperation.\r\n\r\nI focused on my magic--the same stuff I had been using to make water with the showerhead glyph--and pushed it towards the armour. A wash of tiredness swept over me, but that was secondary to what I saw. The dirt and dust flaked off of the armour, the straps took on a faint shine and the cloth looked freshly cleaned.\r\n\r\nI laughed aloud as I spun my totally awesome new armour around. I had magic!\r\n\r\nFirst cleaning spells, next, fireballs! A quick check of my stats showed me just how much I had lost which was kind of disconcerting.\r\n\r\nMana 79/105\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of my total mana. Mana which I knew went up by about one a minute. Still, the amount of time it would have taken me to clean the armour as well as the spell had was... probably the same?\r\n\r\nI flipped the armour back and forth and looked at how clean it was, then considered how long it would take me to reach the same level of cleanliness by hand. About twenty to thirty minutes? Which was the same time it took to regenerate that mana. So it was a fair trade.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of practice I fired off the spell on the skirts and the leather jacket and lost two different amounts of mana, both lower than the gambeson alone. Neat!\r\n\r\n“What do you think, Bonesey?” I asked my skeletal friend.\r\n\r\n“Rrr,” was his bored response.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I guess you saw all sorts of magic in your day, huh?” I told it. “I hope you don’t mind, but I need to get dressed, so...” I reached over and turned Bonesy so that it was facing the far wall. As friendly as we were, well, it wasn’t so friendly that I’d let it see me getting dressed.\r\n\r\nI debated keeping my blouse on or not, but I didn’t want to armour to chafe and the soft cotton of my blouse would keep my skin safe. Still, I took it off and winced at how dirty it had become. Oh, if only I had a solution to that.\r\n\r\nA few more points of mana down the drain and I had a perfectly spotless blouse. One that I was going to wear over skin that hadn’t seen a shower in two and a bit days. Yuck.\r\n\r\nAnother drain of mana and I gasped. I was... clean. Very clean. I was clean all over. ”Oh, wow,” I said as I shifted around. “That’s... refreshing.”\r\n\r\nMana 42/105\r\n\r\nI shrugged and fired off another cleaning spell at my skirt, because I could. Then slid back into my blouse. It felt... itchy. Had I just exfoliated my everything? I had to be careful with this great power.\r\n\r\nStill, it wouldn’t be right not to share!\r\n\r\n“Hey Bonesy, how you you like to be the cleanest, leanest skeleton on this side of... wherever we are?”\r\n\r\n“Rrr?”\r\n\r\n“Uh huh,” I said as I placed one finger onto the bony skull and pushed.\r\n\r\nMagic flowed out of me.\r\n\r\nBonesey shifted, jaw opening, then hanging slack as a ghostly form, just a head and the hint of shoulders, appeared out of the skull.\r\n\r\nDing! Congratulations, you have sent ‘Bonesy. Skeletal Bard’ Level 3 beyond the veil! Bonus Exp was granted for cleansing a monster above your level!\r\n\r\n“Bonesy!” I shouted.\r\n\r\nThe ghostly afterimage above the skull floated up, taking the shape of a man’s face. “Thank you,” he whispered before fading away.\r\n\r\nMy knees crashing into the dusty ground.\r\n\r\n“Bonesy! No, no, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”\r\n'),
('Beneath the Crescent Moon', 'Beware of Chicken', 3, 'Bi De knew fury. One of the red ones had vexed his Great Master. It had nearly slain one of the Great Master’s flocks, somehow managing to sneak past him. He barely sound the alarm in time, his voice berating the foul interloper.\r\n\r\nBut this red one, this vile beast, was skilled. It danced around his blows, and even, horror of horrors, evaded the Great Master’s mighty spur, the one that he used to tame the earth. In all other cases, his iron spur had been a command of death. With a single contemptuous blow, he smote all others.\r\n\r\nBut not for this one.\r\n\r\nAt first, he was stunned nearly to the point of spitting blood. Why did his Great Master not pursue? He could have easily slain the interloper, this demon, if he directed his full and terrible wrath against it.\r\n\r\nHe did not understand, but he knew his Great Master had wisdom that far eclipsed his.\r\n\r\nThrice, the foulspawn did attempt to take what was rightfully the Great Master’s. Thrice, did the Great Master’s mighty blow miss.\r\n\r\nHe even gave it a name from the very pits of hell: Basi Bu Shi. Bi De shuddered whenever he heard it. His Great Master’s words of power contained both virtuous and fell wisdom.\r\n\r\nBut now, he understood. He had figured out the conundrum his Great Master had set before him. His Great Master had once more bought out his mobile coop. He remembered vaguely, before he was enlightened, travelling to these blessed lands upon the mighty fortress from the…. other place that was more hazy.\r\n\r\nSome of his master’s supplies had run low. He wished to return to the other place, so that the people there may give tribute to his glory.\r\n\r\nBut to travel outwards, he would have to leave his home. With only Bi De as it’s guardian.\r\n\r\nAnd he was not strong enough. His weakness was preventing the master from living how he wished. It was unacceptable.\r\n\r\nHe had been issued a challenge, in Basi Bu Shi’s continued existence. A mighty task to prove his worth against the wicked.\r\n\r\nAnd so he redoubled his efforts. His kicks took on new energy. His dance, new grace. He would slay this mighty enemy, and earn his Great Master’s trust.\r\n\r\nThe Great Pillars of The Fa Ram called.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nWell, just a bit more till I head back to Verdant Hill. I’d have to take the chickens along with me, so they didn’t all get eaten. I should probably finally deal with Basil Brush. I was being kind of lazy about it, just chasing him off and hoping he would get the message, but he was becoming persistent.\r\n\r\nI squinted at Big D as I finished dressing the fox pelt.\r\n\r\nWas…. Was my fucking chicken doing a training montage?\r\n\r\nI watched his incredibly crisp kicks for a little longer.\r\n\r\nI shook my head. Nah, I had spent too long alone. Humanising him a bit too much. Or its just cultivator world bullshit.\r\n\r\nAlright, tomorrow I’ll hunt Basil down.\r\n\r\nHeheheh. Boom Boom.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nTonight, he would slay wicked Basi Bu Shi.\r\n\r\nTonight, it would be either glory–or his death. Either were acceptable. If he fell in this battle, it merely proved that he was unworthy of his Great Master’s continued sufferance.\r\n\r\nHe went into the night, hopping from tree to tree in silence. And there, he found his quarry.\r\n\r\nThe beast was arrogant. It stalked, but did not realise others could stalk it.\r\n\r\nIn silence, Bi De descended, and he struck. His legs lashed with great strength, and his enemy snarled in pain.\r\n\r\nHe struck again to press his advantage, but Basi Bu Shi was worthy of his master’s ire, the lithe creature shooting away, but with a deep scar in it’s flesh that leaked blood.\r\n\r\nBi De saw it, in his mortal enemy’s eyes. The spark of awareness. The spark of fury.\r\n\r\nThis one… this one knew too.\r\n\r\nHis foe did not run. It knew he had not called his Great Master. It knew it could lay him low here.\r\n\r\nTheir silent dance began.\r\n\r\nHis legs and spurs cut through the night air, as he flipped and dashed around his enemy’s razor teeth and tearing claws.\r\n\r\nIt tried to strike him with it’s limbs, to foul his footing and drive him to the earth, but he had grown wise to these beast’s tricks, dodging them when he could, and accepting the blow to gain distance when he couldn’t.\r\n\r\nThe two whirls of red chased each other through the trees, bouncing off trees, and leaving scratches in the forest floor.\r\n\r\nBi De felt triumph. He was equally matched with this one– nay, he dared think himself it’s superior. It’s nose was slashed open, one of it’s ears a ragged mass.His spurs ran crimson.\r\n\r\nBut the wicked one could have tricks too. It raised it’s limb, as to strike another blow, sending his wings snapping out to redirect hit momentum.\r\n\r\nHe saw the gleam of satisfaction too late.\r\n\r\nThe paw slammed down instead, launching the wicked one forwards, and the vile Basi Bu Shi became a streamer of red, trailing behind an open maw.\r\n\r\nTeeth crashed down upon his wing. The wicked one shook it’s head savagely, and then threw him across the clearing, to slam into a tree.\r\n\r\nIt was pain like no other. He nearly cried out, he nearly summoned his Great Master, but he refused to. This was his test, and he refused to fail.\r\n\r\nHe staggered to get up, his legs shaking with the effort. But it was for nought.\r\n\r\nBasi Bu Shi drove him to the earth with his mighty paw. He laughed over besting the Great Master’s disciple. He savoured his victory.\r\n\r\nBi De knew only shame, as he lied there, pinned to the base earth. He could not return his Great Master’s Blessings. He could not ever repay him. All he could do is stare up at the night sky in torment.\r\n\r\nThe enormous crescent moon loomed in his vision. It was his favourite phase of the celestial object, and he always contemplated it when it showed its most perfect form. It looked somewhat like his master’s mighty spur– or his own useless, weak ones.\r\n\r\nAh, how he wished for a mighty weapon to slay the wicked.\r\n\r\nThe Crescent Moon loomed.\r\n\r\nBi De, in his last moments, contemplated the lunar glory.\r\n\r\nBi De, in his last moments, understood.\r\n\r\nHe guided his energy and intent true. Blades of light, pure as the moon above, sprung from his limbs.\r\n\r\n[Rising of the Crescent Moon]\r\n\r\nHis body sprung from it’s prone position and he rose as surely as the moon. The wicked could not contain him with it’s paltry strength. The blade struck true, gouging out one of the foulspawn’s eyes as he flipped in the air.\r\n\r\nThe enemy shrieked in pain, its very soul burned by the righteous, heavenly blades he now bore.\r\n\r\nHe hung there a moment, under the moon’s celestial light, gazing down upon his enemy.\r\n\r\nAll things that rise, fall.\r\n\r\n[Descending Lunar Fangs]\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable, as true as the sun, the moon, and the stars set, so too did he once more descend to the base earth, carrying the weight and glory of heaven with him.\r\n\r\nBoth of his glimmering spurs buried themselves in the neck of the red one. This unsightly Basi Bu Shi.\r\n\r\n[Wheel of the Crescent Moon]\r\n\r\nHis legs split apart, once more throwing him into a flip, the white energy forming a ring-like afterimage around him, and parting his mortal enemy’s head from it’s shoulders.\r\n\r\nHe landed gracefully once more upon the earth.\r\n\r\nHis enemy’s head thumped to the ground behind him.\r\n\r\nHe.. he had done it. Bi De had completed his master’s task.\r\n\r\nHe roared his victory to the heavens.\r\n\r\nHis Great Master burst into the clearing upon hearing his cry, fury in his eyes at those who would dare attempt to harm his disciple.\r\n\r\n//////////\r\n\r\nI stumbled to a stop, after once again being called out of bed. The small clearing was cut up from something, and there was Big D, looking pleased as punch, standing on the savaged and beheaded form of Basil Brush.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck?\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nHis Great Master, as always, lavished affection upon him. His broken wing was bandaged. His messed feathers combed, and his wattles rubbed in a most pleasing way.\r\n\r\nHe was delivered back to the coop, and fed full sprigs of Heavenly Herbs. His Great Master Commanded him to replenish, and enjoy himself.\r\n\r\nHe was a good disciple of his Great Master. He had passed his test, and was now to be granted guardianship of The Great Fa Ram, trusted to hold faith for his Lord while he braved the world. \r\n'),
('Chapter 1', 'Snow Crash', 1, 'The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory. He\'s got esprit\r\nup to here. Right now, he is preparing to carry out his third mission of the night.\r\nHis uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air.\r\nA bullet will bounce off its arachnofiber weave like a wren hitting a patio door,\r\nbut excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed\r\nforest. Where his body has bony extremities, the suit has sintered armorgel: feels\r\nlike gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books.\r\nWhen they gave him the job, they gave him a gun. The Deliverator never\r\ndeals in cash, but someone might come after him anyway—might want his car,\r\nor his cargo. The gun is tiny, aero-styled, lightweight, the kind of a gun a fashion\r\ndesigner would carry; it fires teensy darts that fly at five times the velocity of an\r\nSR-71 spy plane, and when you get done using it, you have to plug it into the\r\ncigarette lighter, because it runs on electricity.\r\nThe Deliverator never pulled that gun in anger, or in fear. He pulled it once in\r\nGila Highlands. Some punks in Gila Highlands, a fancy Burbclave, wanted\r\nthemselves a delivery, and they didn\'t want to pay for it. Thought they would\r\nimpress the Deliverator with a baseball bat. The Deliverator took out his gun,\r\ncentered its laser doo-hickey on that poised Louisville Slugger, fired it. The\r\nrecoil was immense, as though the weapon had blown up in his hand. The\r\nmiddle third of the baseball bat turned into a column of burning sawdust\r\naccelerating in all directions like a bursting star. Punk ended up holding this bat\r\nhandle with milky smoke pouring out the end. Stupid look on his face. Didn\'t get\r\nnothing but trouble from the Deliverator.\r\nSince then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment and\r\nrelied, instead, on a matched set of samurai swords, which have always been his\r\nweapon of choice anyhow. The punks in Gila Highlands weren\'t afraid of the\r\ngun, so the Deliverator was forced to use it. But swords need no demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThe Deliverator\'s car has enough potential energy packed into its batteries to\r\nfire a pound of bacon into the Asteroid Belt. Unlike a bimbo box or a Burb\r\nbeater, the Deliverator\'s car unloads that power through gaping, gleaming,\r\npolished sphincters. When the Deliverator puts the hammer down, shit happens.\r\nYou want to talk contact patches? Your car\'s tires have tiny contact patches, talk\r\nto the asphalt in four places the size of your tongue. The Deliverator\'s car has big\r\nsticky tires with contact patches the size of a fat lady\'s thighs. The Deliverator is\r\nin touch with the road, starts like a bad day, stops on a peseta.\r\nWhy is the Deliverator so equipped? Because people rely on him. He is a roll\r\nmodel. This is America. People do whatever the fuck they feel like doing, you\r\ngot a problem with that? Because they have a right to. And because they have\r\nguns and no one can fucking stop them. As a result, this country has one of the\r\nworst economies in the world. When it gets down to it—talking trade balances\r\nhere—once we\'ve brain-drained all our technology into other countries, once\r\nthings have evened out, they\'re making cars in Bolivia and microwave ovens in\r\nTadzhikistan and selling them here—once our edge in natural resources has been\r\nmade irrelevant by giant Hong Kong ships and dirigibles that can ship North\r\nDakota all the way to New Zealand for a nickel—once the Invisible Hand has\r\ntaken all those historical inequities and smeared them out into a broad global\r\nlayer of what a Pakistani brickmaker would consider to be prosperity—y\'know\r\nwhat? There\'s only four things we do better than anyone else\r\nmusic\r\nmovies\r\nmicrocode (software)\r\nhigh-speed pizza delivery\r\nThe Deliverator used to make software. Still does, sometimes. But if life were\r\na mellow elementary school run by well-meaning education Ph.D.s, the\r\nDeliverator\'s report card would say: “Hiro is so bright and creative but needs to9\r\nwork harder on his cooperation skills.”\r\nSo now he has this other job. No brightness or creativity involved—but no\r\ncooperation either. Just a single principle: The Deliverator stands tall, your pie in\r\nthirty minutes or you can have it free, shoot the driver, take his car, file a class-\r\naction suit. The Deliverator has been working this job for six months, a rich and\r\nlengthy tenure by his standards, and has never delivered a pizza in more than\r\ntwenty-one minutes.\r\nOh, they used to argue over times, many corporate driver-years lost to it:\r\nhomeowners, red-faced and sweaty with their own lies, stinking of Old Spice\r\nand job-related stress, standing in their glowing yellow doorways brandishing\r\ntheir Seikos and waving at the clock over the kitchen sink, I swear, can\'t you\r\nguys tell time?\r\nDidn\'t happen anymore. Pizza delivery is a major industry. A managed\r\nindustry. People went to CosaNostra Pizza University four years just to learn it.\r\nCame in its doors unable to write an English sentence, from Abkhazia, Rwanda,\r\nGuanajuato, South Jersey, and came out knowing more about pizza than a\r\nBedouin knows about sand. And they had studied this problem. Graphed the\r\nfrequency of doorway delivery-time disputes. Wired the early Deliverators to\r\nrecord, then analyze, the debating tactics, the voice-stress histograms, the\r\ndistinctive grammatical structures employed by white middle-class Type A\r\nBurbclave occupants who against all logic had decided that this was the place to\r\ntake their personal Custerian stand against all that was stale and deadening in\r\ntheir lives: they were going to lie, or delude themselves, about the time of their\r\nphone call and get themselves a free pizza; no, they deserved a free pizza along\r\nwith their life, liberty, and pursuit of whatever, it was fucking inalienable. Sent\r\npsychologists out to these people\'s houses, gave them a free TV set to submit to\r\nan anonymous interview, hooked them to polygraphs, studied their brain waves\r\nas they showed them choppy, inexplicable movies of porn queens and late-night\r\ncar crashes and Sammy Davis, Jr., put them in sweet-smelling, mauve-walled\r\nrooms and asked them questions about Ethics so perplexing that even a Jesuit\r\ncouldn\'t respond without committing a venial sin.\r\nThe analysts at CosaNostra Pizza University concluded that it was just human\r\nnature and you couldn\'t fix it, and so they went for a quick cheap technical fix:\r\nsmart boxes. The pizza box is a plastic carapace now, corrugated for stiffness, a10\r\nlittle LED readout glowing on the side, telling the Deliverator how many trade\r\nimbalance-producing minutes have ticked away since the fateful phone call.\r\nThere are chips and stuff in there. The pizzas rest, a short stack of them, in slots\r\nbehind the Deliverator\'s head. Each pizza glides into a slot like a circuit board\r\ninto a computer, clicks into place as the smart box interfaces with the onboard\r\nsystem of the Deliverator\'s car. The address of the caller has already been\r\ninferred from his phone number and poured into the smart box\'s built-in RAM.\r\nFrom there it is communicated to the car, which computes and projects the\r\noptimal route on a heads-up display, a glowing colored map traced out against\r\nthe windshield so that the Deliverator does not even have to glance down.\r\nIf the thirty-minute deadline expires, news of the disaster is flashed to\r\nCosaNostra Pizza Headquarters and relayed from there to Uncle Enzo himself—\r\nthe Sicilian Colonel Sanders, the Andy Griffith of Bensonhurst, the straight\r\nrazor-swinging figment of many a Deliverator\'s nightmares, the Capo and prime\r\nfigurehead of CosaNostra Pizza, Incorporated—who will be on the phone to the\r\ncustomer within five minutes, apologizing profusely. The next day, Uncle Enzo\r\nwill land on the customer\'s yard in a jet helicopter and apologize some more and\r\ngive him a free trip to Italy—all he has to do is sign a bunch of releases that\r\nmake him a public figure and spokesperson for CosaNostra Pizza and basically\r\nend his private life as he knows it. He will come away from the whole thing\r\nfeeling that, somehow, he owes the Mafia a favor.\r\nThe Deliverator does not know for sure what happens to the driver in such\r\ncases, but he has heard some rumors. Most pizza deliveries happen in the\r\nevening hours, which Uncle Enzo considers to be his private time. And how\r\nwould you feel if you had to interrupt dinner with your family in order to call\r\nsome obstreperous dork in a Burbclave and grovel for a late fucking pizza?\r\nUncle Enzo has not put in fifty years serving his family and his country so that,\r\nat the age when most are playing golf and bobbling their granddaughters, he can\r\nget out of the bathtub dripping wet and lie down and kiss the feet of some\r\nsixteen-year-old skate punk whose pepperoni was thirty-one minutes in coming.\r\nOh, God. It makes the Deliverator breathe a little shallower just to think of the\r\nidea.\r\nBut he wouldn\'t drive for CosaNostra Pizza any other way. You know why?\r\nBecause there\'s something about having your life on the line. It\'s like being a\r\nkamikaze pilot. Your mind is clear. Other people—store clerks, burger flippers,11\r\nsoftware engineers, the whole vocabulary of meaningless jobs that make up Life\r\nin America—other people just rely on plain old competition. Better flip your\r\nburgers or debug your subroutines faster and better than your high school\r\nclassmate two blocks down the strip is flipping or debugging, because we\'re in\r\ncompetition with those guys, and people notice these things.\r\nWhat a fucking rat race that is. CosaNostra Pizza doesn\'t have any\r\ncompetition. Competition goes against the Mafia ethic. You don\'t work harder\r\nbecause you\'re competing against some identical operation down the street. You\r\nwork harder because everything is on the line. Your name, your honor, your\r\nfamily, your life. Those burger flippers might have a better life expectancy—but\r\nwhat kind of life is it anyway, you have to ask yourself. That\'s why nobody, not\r\neven the Nipponese, can move pizzas faster than CosaNostra. The Deliverator is\r\nproud to wear the uniform, proud to drive the car, proud to march up the front\r\nwalks of innumerable Burbclave homes, a grim vision in ninja black, a pizza on\r\nhis shoulder, red LED digits blazing proud numbers into the night: 12:32 or\r\n15:15 or the occasional 20:43.\r\nThe Deliverator is assigned to CosaNostra Pizza #3569 in the Valley. Southern\r\nCalifornia doesn\'t know whether to bustle or just strangle itself on the spot. Not\r\nenough roads for the number of people. Fairlanes, Inc. is laying new ones all the\r\ntime. Have to bulldoze lots of neighborhoods to do it, but those seventies and\r\neighties developments exist to be bulldozed, right? No sidewalks, no schools, no\r\nnothing. Don\'t have their own police force—no immigration control—\r\nundesirables can walk right in without being frisked or even harassed. Now a\r\nBurbclave, that\'s the place to live. A city-state with its own constitution, a\r\nborder, laws, cops, everything.\r\nThe Deliverator was a corporal in the Farms of Merryvale State Security\r\nForce for a while once. Got himself fired for pulling a sword on an\r\nacknowledged perp. Slid it right through the fabric of the perp\'s shirt, gliding the\r\nflat of the blade along the base of his neck, and pinned him to a warped and\r\nbubbled expanse of vinyl siding on the wall of the house that the perp was trying\r\nto break into. Thought it was a pretty righteous bust. But they fired him anyway\r\nbecause the perp turned out to be the son of the vice-chancellor of the Farms of\r\nMerryvale. Oh, the weasels had an excuse: said that a thirty-six-inch samurai\r\nsword was not on their Weapons Protocol. Said that he had violated the SPAC,\r\nthe Suspected Perpetrator Apprehension Code. Said that the perp had suffered12\r\npsychological trauma. He was afraid of butter knives now; he had to spread his\r\njelly with the back of a teaspoon. They said that he had exposed them to liability.\r\nThe Deliverator had to borrow some money to pay for it. Had to borrow it\r\nfrom the Mafia, in fact. So he\'s in their database now—retinal patterns, DNA,\r\nvoice graph, fingerprints, footprints, palm prints, wrist prints, every fucking part\r\nof the body that had wrinkles on it—almost—those bastards rolled in ink and\r\nmade a print and digitized it into their computer. But it\'s their money—sure\r\nthey\'re careful about loaning it out. And when he applied for the Deliverator job\r\nthey were happy to take him, because they knew him. When he got the loan, he\r\nhad to deal personally with the assistant vice-capo of the Valley, who later\r\nrecommended him for the Deliverator job. So it was like being in a family. A\r\nreally scary, twisted, abusive family.\r\nCosaNostra Pizza #3569 is on Vista Road just down from Kings Park Mall.\r\nVista Road used to belong to the State of California and now is called Fairlanes,\r\nInc. Rte. CSV-5. Its main competition used to be a U.S. highway and is now\r\ncalled Cruiseways, Inc. Rte. Cal-12. Farther up the Valley, the two competing\r\nhighways actually cross. Once there had been bitter disputes, the intersection\r\nclosed by sporadic sniper fire. Finally, a big developer bought the entire\r\nintersection and turned it into a drive-through mall. Now the roads just feed into\r\na parking system—not a lot, not a ramp, but a system—and lose their identity.\r\nGetting through the intersection involves tracing paths through the parking\r\nsystem, many braided filaments of direction like the Ho Chi Minh trail. CSV-5\r\nhas better throughput, but Cal-12 has better pavement. That is typical—Fairlanes\r\nroads emphasize getting you there, for Type A drivers, and Cruiseways\r\nemphasize the enjoyment of the ride, for Type B drivers.\r\nThe Deliverator is a Type A driver with rabies. He is zeroing in on his home\r\nbase, CosaNostra Pizza #3569, cranking up the left lane of CSV-5 at a hundred\r\nand twenty kilometers. His car is an invisible black lozenge, just a dark place\r\nthat reflects the tunnel of franchise signs—the loglo. A row of orange lights\r\nburbles and churns across the front, where the grille would be if this were an air-\r\nbreathing car. The orange light looks like a gasoline fire. It comes in through\r\npeople\'s rear windows, bounces off their rearview mirrors, projects a fiery mask\r\nacross their eyes, reaches into their subconscious, and unearths terrible fears of\r\nbeing pinned, fully conscious, under a detonating gas tank, makes them want to\r\npull over and let the Deliverator overtake them in his black chariot of pepperoni13\r\nfire.\r\nThe loglo, overhead, marking out CSV-5 in twin contrails, is a body of\r\nelectrical light made of innumerable cells, each cell designed in Manhattan by\r\nimageers who make more for designing a single logo than a Deliverator will\r\nmake in his entire lifetime. Despite their efforts to stand out, they all smear\r\ntogether, especially at a hundred and twenty kilometers per hour. Still, it is easy\r\nto see CosaNostra Pizza #3569 because of the billboard, which is wide and tall\r\neven by current inflated standards. In fact, the squat franchise itself looks like\r\nnothing more than a low-slung base for the great aramid fiber pillars that thrust\r\nthe billboard up into the trademark firmament. Marca Registrada, baby.\r\nThe billboard is a classic, a chestnut, not a figment of some fleeting Mafia\r\npromotional campaign. It is a statement, a monument built to endure. Simple and\r\ndignified. It shows Uncle Enzo in one of his spiffy Italian suits. The pinstripes\r\nglint and flex like sinews. The pocket square is luminous. His hair is perfect,\r\nslicked back with something that never comes off, each strand cut off straight\r\nand square at the end by Uncle Enzo\'s cousin, Art the Barber, who runs the\r\nsecond-largest chain of low-end haircutting establishments in the world. Uncle\r\nEnzo is standing there, not exactly smiling, an avuncular glint in his eye for sure,\r\nnot posing like a model but standing there like your uncle would, and it says\r\nThe Mafia\r\nyou\'ve got a friend in The Family!\r\npaid for by the Our Thing Foundation\r\nThe billboard serves as the Deliverator\'s polestar. He knows that when he gets\r\nto the place on CSV-5 where the bottom corner of the billboard is obscured by\r\nthe pseudo-Gothic stained-glass arches of the local Reverend Wayne\'s Pearly\r\nGates franchise, it\'s time for him to get over into the right lanes where the retards\r\nand the bimbo boxes poke along, random, indecisive, looking at each passing\r\nfranchise\'s driveway like they don\'t know if it\'s a promise or a threat.14\r\nHe cuts off a bimbo box—a family minivan—veers past the Buy \'n\' Fly that is\r\nnext door, and pulls into CosaNostra Pizza #3569. Those big fat contact patches\r\ncomplain, squeal a little bit, but they hold on to the patented Fairlanes, Inc. high-\r\ntraction pavement and guide him into the chute. No other Deliverators are\r\nwaiting in the chute. That is good, that means high turnover for him, fast action,\r\nkeep moving that \'za. As he scrunches to a stop, the electromechanical hatch on\r\nthe flank of his car is already opening to reveal his empty pizza slots, the door\r\nclicking and folding back in on itself like the wing of a beetle. The slots are\r\nwaiting. Waiting for hot pizza.\r\nAnd waiting. The Deliverator honks his horn. This is not a nominal outcome.\r\nWindow slides open. That should never happen. You can look at the three-ring\r\nbinder from CosaNostra Pizza University, cross-reference the citation for\r\nwindow, chute, dispatcher\'s, and it will give you all the procedures for that\r\nwindow—and it should never be opened. Unless something has gone wrong.\r\nThe window slides open and—you sitting down?—smoke comes out of it. The\r\nDeliverator hears a discordant beetling over the metal hurricane of his sound\r\nsystem and realizes that it is a smoke alarm, coming from inside the franchise.\r\nMute button on the stereo. Oppressive silence—his eardrums uncringe—the\r\nwindow is buzzing with the cry of the smoke alarm. The car idles, waiting. The\r\nhatch has been open too long, atmospheric pollutants are congealing on the\r\nelectrical contacts in the back of the pizza slots, he\'ll have to clean them ahead of\r\nschedule, everything is going exactly the way it shouldn\'t go in the three-ring\r\nbinder that spells out all the rhythms of the pizza universe.\r\nInside, a football-shaped Abkhazian man is running to and fro, holding a\r\nthree-ring binder open, using his spare tire as a ledge to keep it from collapsing\r\nshut; he runs with the gait of a man carrying an egg on a spoon. He is shouting in\r\nthe Abkhazian dialect; all the people who run CosaNostra pizza franchises in this\r\npart of the Valley are Abkhazian immigrants.\r\nIt does not look like a serious fire. The Deliverator saw a real fire once, at the\r\nFarms of Merryvale, and you couldn\'t see anything for the smoke. That\'s all it\r\nwas: smoke, burbling out of nowhere, occasional flashes of orange light down at\r\nthe bottom, like heat lightning in tall clouds. This is not that kind of fire. It is the15\r\n'),

('Gestation 1', 'Worm', 1, 'Class ended in five minutes and all I could think was, an hour is too long for lunch.\r\n\r\nSince the start of the semester, I had been looking forward to the part of Mr. Gladly’s World Issues class where we’d start discussing capes.  Now that it had finally arrived, I couldn’t focus.  I fidgeted, my pen moving from hand to hand, tapping, or absently drawing some figure in the corner of the page to join the other doodles.  My eyes were restless too, darting from the clock above the door to Mr. Gladly and back to the clock.  I wasn’t picking up enough of his lesson to follow along.  Twenty minutes to twelve; five minutes left before class ended.\r\n\r\nHe was animated, clearly excited about what he was talking about, and for once, the class was listening.  He was the sort of teacher who tried to be friends with his students, the sort who went by “Mr. G” instead of Mr. Gladly.  He liked to end class a little earlier than usual and chat with the popular kids, gave lots of group work so others could hang out with their friends in class, and had ‘fun’ assignments like mock trials.\r\n\r\nHe struck me as one of the ‘popular’ kids who had become a teacher.  He probably thought he was everyone’s favorite.  I wondered how he’d react if he heard my opinion on the subject.  Would it shatter his self image or would he shrug it off as an anomaly from the gloomy girl that never spoke up in class?\r\n\r\nI glanced over my shoulder.  Madison Clements sat two rows to my left and two seats back.  She saw me looking and smirked, her eyes narrowing, and I lowered my eyes to my notebook.  I tried to ignore the ugly, sour feeling that stewed in my stomach.  I glanced up at the clock.  Eleven-forty-three.\r\n\r\n“Let me wrap up here,” Mr. Gladly said, “Sorry, guys, but there is homework for the weekend.  Think about capes and how they’ve impacted the world around you.  Make a list if you want, but it’s not mandatory.  On Monday we’ll break up into groups of four and see what group has the best list.  I’ll buy the winning group treats from the vending machine.”\r\n\r\nThere were a series of cheers, followed by the classroom devolving into noisy chaos.  The room was filled with sounds of binders snapping shut, textbooks and notebooks being slammed closed, chairs screeching on cheap tile and the dull roar of emerging conversation.  A bunch of the more social members of the class gathered around Mr. Gladly to chat.\r\n\r\nMe?  I just put my books away and kept quiet.  I’d written down almost nothing in the way of notes; there were collections of doodles spreading across the page and numbers in the margins where I’d counted down the minutes to lunch as if I was keeping track of the timer on a bomb.\r\n\r\nMadison was talking with her friends.  She was popular, but not gorgeous in the way the stereotypical popular girls on TV were.  She was ‘adorable’, instead.  Petite.  She played up the image with sky blue pins in her shoulder length brown hair and a cutesy attitude. Madison wore a strapless top and denim skirt, which seemed absolutely moronic to me given the fact that it was still early enough in the spring that we could see our breath in the mornings.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t exactly in a position to criticize her.  Boys liked her and she had friends, while the same was hardly true for me.  The only feminine feature I had going for me was my dark curly hair, which I’d grown long.  The clothes I wore didn’t show skin, and I didn’t deck myself out in bright colors like a bird showing off its plumage.\r\n\r\nGuys liked her, I think, because she was appealing without being intimidating.\r\n\r\nIf they only knew.\r\n\r\nThe bell rang with a lilting ding-dong, and I was the first one out the door.  I didn’t run, but I moved at a decent clip as I headed up the stairwell to the third floor and made my way to the girl’s washroom.\r\n\r\nThere were a half dozen girls there already, which meant I had to wait for a stall to open up.  I nervously watched the door of the bathroom, feeling my heart drop every time someone entered the room.\r\n\r\nAs soon as there was a free stall, I let myself in and locked the door.   I leaned against the wall and exhaled slowly.  It wasn’t quite a sigh of relief.  Relief implied you felt better.  I wouldn’t feel better until I got home.  No, I just felt less uneasy.\r\n\r\nIt took maybe five minutes before the noise of others in the washroom stopped.  A peek below the partitions showed that there was nobody else in the other stalls.  I sat on the lid of the toilet and got my brown bag lunch to begin eating.\r\n\r\nLunch on the toilet was routine now.  Every school day, I would finish off my brown bag lunch, then I’d do homework or read a book until lunch hour was over.  The only book in my bag that I hadn’t already read was called ‘Triumvirate’, a biography of the leading three members of the Protectorate.  I was thinking I would spend as long as I could on Mr. Gladly’s assignment before reading, because I wasn’t enjoying the book.  Biographies weren’t my thing, and they were especially not my thing when I was suspicious it was all made up.\r\n\r\nWhatever my plan, I didn’t even have a chance to finish my pita wrap.  The door of the bathroom banged open.  I froze.  I didn’t want to rustle the bag and clue anyone into what I was doing, so I kept still and listened.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t make out the voices.  The noise of the conversation was obscured by giggling and the sound of water from the sinks.  There was a knock on the door, making me jump.  I ignored it, but the person on the other side just repeated the knock.\r\n\r\n“Occupied,” I called out, hesitantly.\r\n\r\n“Oh my god, it’s Taylor!” one of the girls on the outside exclaimed with glee, then in response to something another girl whispered, I barely heard her add, “Yeah, do it!”\r\n\r\nI stood up abruptly, letting the brown bag with the last mouthful of my lunch fall to the tiled floor.  Rushing for the door, I popped the lock open and pushed.  The door didn’t budge.\r\n\r\nThere were noises from the stalls on either side of me, then a sound above me.  I looked up to see what it was, only to get splashed in the face.  My eyes started burning, and I was momentarily blinded by the stinging fluid in my eyes and my blurring of my glasses.  I could taste it as it ran down to my nose and mouth.  Cranberry juice.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t stop there.  I managed to pull my glasses off just in time to see Madison and Sophia leaning over the top of the stall, each of them with plastic bottles at the ready.  I bent over with my hands shielding my head just before they emptied the contents over me.\r\n\r\nIt ran down the back of my neck, soaked my clothes, fizzed as it ran through my hair.  I pushed against the door again, but the girl on the other side was braced against it with her body.\r\n\r\nIf the girls pouring juice and soda on me were Madison and Sophia, that meant the girl on the other side of the door was Emma, leader of the trio.  Feeling a flare of anger at the realization, I shoved on the door, the full weight of my body slamming against it.  I didn’t accomplish anything, and my shoes lost traction on the juice-slick floor.  I fell to my knees in the puddling juice.\r\n\r\nEmpty plastic bottles with labels for grape and cranberry juice fell to the ground around me.  A bottle of orange soda bounced off my shoulder to splash into the puddle before rolling under the partition and into the next stall.  The smell of the fruity drinks and sodas was sickly sweet.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open, and I glared up at the three girls.  Madison, Sophia and Emma.  Where Madison was cute, a late bloomer, Sophia and Emma were the types of girls that fit the ‘prom queen’ image.  Sophia was dark skinned, with a slender, athletic build she’d developed as a runner on the school track team.  Red-headed Emma, by contrast, had all the curves the guys wanted.  She was good looking enough to get occasional jobs as a amateur model for the catalogs that the local department stores and malls put out.  The three of them were laughing like it was the funniest thing in the world, but the sounds of their amusement barely registered with me.  My attention was on the faint roar of blood pumping in my ears and an urgent, ominous crackling ‘sound’ that wouldn’t get any quieter or less persistent if I covered my ears with my hands.  I could feel dribbles running down my arms and back, still chilled from the refrigerated vending machines.\r\n\r\nI didn’t trust myself to say something that wouldn’t give them fodder to taunt me with, so I kept silent.\r\n\r\nCarefully, I climbed to my feet and turned my back on them to get my backpack off the top of the toilet.  Seeing it gave me pause.  It had been a khaki green, before, but now dark purple blotches covered it, most of the contents of a bottle of grape juice.  Pulling the straps around my shoulders, I turned around.  The girls weren’t there.  I heard the bathroom door bang shut, cutting off the sounds of their glee, leaving me alone in the bathroom, drenched.\r\n\r\nI approached the sink and stared at myself in the scratched, stained mirror that was bolted above it.  I had inherited a thin lipped, wide, expressive mouth from my mother, but my large eyes and my gawky figure made me look a lot more like my dad.  My dark hair was soaked enough that it clung to my scalp, neck and shoulders.  I was wearing a brown hooded sweatshirt over a green t-shirt, but colored blotches of purple, red and orange streaked both.  My glasses were beaded with the multicolored droplets of juice and soda.  A drip ran down my nose and fell from the tip to land in the sink.\r\n\r\nUsing a paper towel from the dispenser, I wiped my glasses off and put them on again.  The residual streaks made it just as hard to see, if not worse than it had been.\r\n\r\nDeep breaths, Taylor, I told myself.\r\n\r\nI pulled the glasses off to clean them again with a wet towel, and found the streaks were still there.\r\n\r\nAn inarticulate scream of fury and frustration escaped my lips, and I kicked the plastic bucket that sat just beneath the sink, sending it and the toilet brush inside flying into the wall.  When that wasn’t enough, I pulled off my backpack and used a two-handed grip to hurl it.  I wasn’t using my locker anymore: certain individuals had vandalized or broken into it on four different occasions.  My bag was heavy, loaded down with everything I’d anticipated needing for the day’s classes.  It crunched audibly on impact with the wall.\r\n\r\n“What the fuck!?” I screamed to nobody in particular, my voice echoing in the bathroom.  There were tears in the corners of my eyes.\r\n\r\n“The hell am I supposed to do!?”  I wanted to hit something, break something.  To retaliate against the unfairness of the world.  I almost struck the mirror, but I held back.  It was such a small thing that it felt like it would make me feel more insignificant instead of venting my frustration.\r\n\r\nI’d been enduring this from the very first day of high school, a year and a half ago.  The bathroom had been the closest thing I could find to refuge.  It had been lonely and undignified, but it had been a place I could retreat to, a place where I was off their radar.  Now I didn’t even have that.\r\n\r\nI didn’t even know what I was supposed to do for my afternoon classes.  Our midterm project for art was due, and I couldn’t go to class like this.  Sophia would be there, and I could just imagine her smug smile of satisfaction as I showed up looking like I’d botched an attempt to tie-dye everything I owned.\r\n\r\nBesides, I’d just thrown my bag against the wall and I doubted my project was still in one piece.\r\n\r\nThe buzzing at the edge of my consciousness was getting worse.  My hands shook as I bent over and gripped the edge of the sink, let out a long, slow breath, and let my defenses drop.  For three months, I’d held back.  Right now?  I didn’t care anymore.\r\n\r\nI shut my eyes and felt the buzzing crystallize into concrete information.  As numerous as stars in the night sky, tiny knots of intricate data filled the area around me.  I could focus on each one in turn, pick out details.  The clusters of data had been reflexively drifting towards me since I was first splashed in the face.  They responded to my subconscious thoughts and emotions, as much of a reflection of my frustration, my anger, my hatred for those three girls as my pounding heart and trembling hands were.  I could make them stop or direct them to move almost without thinking about it, the same way I could raise an arm or twitch a finger.\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes.  I could feel adrenaline thrumming through my body, blood coursing in my veins.  I shivered in response to the chilled soft drinks and juices the trio had poured over me, with anticipation and with just a little fear.  On every surface of the bathroom were bugs; Flies, ants, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, earwigs, beetles, wasps and bees.  With every passing second, more streamed in through the open window and the various openings in the bathroom, moving with surprising speed.  Some crawled in through a gap where the sink drain entered the wall while others emerged from the triangular hole in the ceiling where a section of foam tile had broken off, or from the opened window with peeling paint and cigarette butts squished out in the recesses.  They gathered around me and spread out over every available surface; primitive bundles of signals and responses, waiting for further instruction.\r\n\r\nMy practice sessions, conducted away from prying eyes, told me I could direct a single insect to move an antennae, or command the gathered horde to move in formation.  With one thought, I could single out a particular group, maturity or species from this jumble and direct them as I wished.  An army of soldiers under my complete control.\r\n\r\nIt would be so easy, so easy to just go Carrie on the school.  To give the trio their just desserts and make them regret what they had put me through: the vicious e-mails, the trash they’d upended over my desk, the flute –my mother’s flute– they’d stolen from my locker.  It wasn’t just them either.  Other girls and a small handful of boys had joined in, ‘accidentally’ skipping over me when passing out assignment handouts, adding their own voices to the taunts and the flood of nasty emails, to get the favor and attention of three of the prettier and more popular girls in our grade.\r\n\r\nI was all too aware that I’d get caught and arrested if I attacked my fellow students.  There were three teams of superheroes and any number of solo heroes in the city.  I didn’t really care.  The thought of my father seeing the aftermath on the news, his disappointment in me, his shame?  That was more daunting, but it still didn’t outweigh the anger and frustration.\r\n\r\nExcept I was better than that.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, I sent an instruction to the gathered swarm.   Disperse.  The word wasn’t as important  as the idea behind it.  They began to exit the room, disappearing into the cracks in the tile and through the open window.  I walked over to the door and stood with my back to it so nobody could stumble onto the scene before the bugs were all gone.\r\n\r\nHowever much I wanted to, I couldn’t really follow through.  Even as I trembled with humiliation, I managed to convince myself to pick up my backpack and head down the hall.  I made my way out of the school, ignoring the stares and giggles from everyone I walked past, and caught the first bus that headed in the general direction of home.  The chill of early spring compounded the discomfort of my soaked hair and clothes, making me shiver.\r\n\r\nI was going to be a superhero.  That was the goal I used to calm myself down at moments like these.  It was what I used to make myself get out of bed on a school day.  It was a crazy dream that made things tolerable.  It was something to look forward to, something to work towards.  It made it possible to keep from dwelling on the fact that Emma Barnes, leader of the trio, had once been my best friend.'),
('Gestation 2', 'Worm', 2, 'My thoughts were on Emma on the bus ride home.  For an outside observer, I think it’s easy to trivialize the importance of a ‘best friend’, but when you’re a kid, there’s nobody more important.  Emma had been my ‘BFF’ from grade one all the way through middle school.  It hadn’t been enough for us to spend our time together at school, so we had alternated staying at each others houses every weekend.

('Gestation 4', 'Worm', 4, 'I felt a chill.  A part of me really wished that I had thought to get my hands on a disposable cell phone.

I could have fit a cell phone back there.  With a cell phone, I could have alerted the real heroes about the fact that Lung was planning to take a score of his flunkies to go and shoot kids.'),
('Gestation 5', 'Worm', 5, 'You don’t properly appreciate what superhuman strength means until you see someone leap from the sidewalk to the second floor of a building on the far side of the street.  He didn’t make it all the way to the roof, but he came to a point maybe three quarters of the way up.  I wasn’t sure just how Lung kept from falling, but I could only guess that he just buried his fingertips into the building’s exterior.'),
('Gestation 6', 'Worm', 6, 'I heard the cape arrive on his souped up motorcycle.  I didn’t want to be seen fleeing the scene of a fight, and risk being labeled one of the bad guys by yet another person, but I wasn’t about to get closer to the street either, in case Lung was feeling better.  Since there was nowhere to go, I just stayed put.  Just resting felt good.'),
('Girl Talk', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 10, '\r\n\r\nMom smiled at me, a warm, happy smile. “Elaine. You’re now old enough to know some girl secrets.” Oh no. Was I about to get the birds and the bees talk? Please no. Please spare me.\r\n\r\n“I have no chore-related skills, although some of my skills can be used for chores. Most women don’t have chore-related skills, although something like a [Tailor] class is pretty common. We spend all day doing chores – Aster knows I’d love your dad to pitch in more – we don’t need any skills to help us with it. Feel free to get rid of the [Cleaning] skill – dad just asked you to get it as a favor to me. But shhhh! Don’t tell him that you’ve gotten rid of it.” Mom put a finger over her mouth and conspiratorially winked at me.\r\n\r\n“You saw the other day that life isn’t that nice here in the Republic for women. It’s shitty. It’s terrible. But there’s nothing me or you can do about it. Men have the money. Men have the power. Men make the rules. We’re not allowed to own property, inherit, or become citizens. So, we do the best we can with the knucklebones we’ve been given. One of those bones is we’re pretty free to pick our skills. Men get lots of skills to help with their profession, but we’re not seen as good enough to be potters or cobblers. We’re just expected to stay home, and support our husbands.” A bitter look crossed mom’s face. Whoa. Where was all of this coming from? Mom, a staunch feminist? From everything I had seen so far, it seemed like she had completely bought into the system. That illusion was rapidly being pulled away from me.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t like I was an unrepentant troublemaker who caused chaos at every opportunity. Not like how Lyra was.\r\n\r\n“What we can do though, is pick our skills. We can work together. We can support each other. We all have some influence over our husbands. Some more than others. Senator Saturio, for example, is mostly just a figurehead for his wife, Venus, who holds all of the real power. The shame is, as amazing of a woman that she is, she’s not allowed to be the Senator. It has to be Saturio. And if they ever got in a real fight, Saturio would still win.”\r\n\r\nMy flycatcher was rapidly expanding in size, my lower jaw about to become intimately familiar with the ground.\r\n\r\n“That’s why I was putting such a strong emphasis on social skills for you. The only real power you’re going to have, the only way you’ll be able to navigate through society, is with social skills, with interacting with others, with keeping your head down and making the small changes and influences that you can. Otherwise the Republic will eat you up and spit you out again, and I don’t want to see that happen to you, my sweet baby girl.” She reached out with a single delicate finger, closing my jaw. My muscles didn’t engage as she released her finger, jaw dropping right back open.\r\n\r\n\"First off, you should take [Vigilant]. You’ve never been all that social, and with your social graces, I suspect you’re going to run into problems. I’m going to make sure you can see them coming. Second, you seem to like helping me out when I’m healing someone, right?”\r\n\r\nHealing Lyra had unlocked new feelings and emotions. I wanted to be a healer like mom. I wanted to make people better, to see their happy faces. I wanted to use that little bit of extra knowledge I had. I nodded briskly. Yeah, I could happily make this my choice.\r\n\r\n“Then take [First Aid] and [Anatomy] as well. Chores are easy, medicine is hard – let’s get you some skills in it. It will help you select your first class, if we decide on you taking [Healer].” I nodded, then realized.\r\n\r\n[Vigilant: You’re constantly on guard for trouble, aware of your surroundings at all times. Increased perception and awareness per level. -3 Mana Regeneration.]\r\n\r\n[First Aid: You’ve responded to injuries soon after they’ve occurred, and patched people up. Increased knowledge and dexterity when responding to injuries. -3 Mana Regeneration when in-use.]\r\n\r\n[Anatomy: You have fantastic knowledge of the human body, but it’s surface-level. Increased knowledge and learning of Anatomy per level. -4 Mana Regeneration.]\r\n\r\n“Hey wait, that’s three skills? Weren’t you only supposed to do two?”\r\n\r\nMom gave me a Look. Ack, talking back was going to get me killed one day. No spoon though.\r\n\r\n“One, we’re getting rid of [Cleaning]. That gives me an extra slot to work with. Two, I could dictate everything you pick. Three, you wanted [First Aid]. So no more back-talk from you.” I sheepishly nodded my head. Aye-Aye captain. Your wish is my command.\r\n\r\n“So now let’s work on the three skills you pick for yourself. Two questions to ask yourself. First: Does anything really call to you? Does anything speak to you, speak to your soul? Second: What do you want to do with yourself? How do you see yourself going through life? If you’re not sure, that’s OK. It’s a lot to ask of you. You can stay without classing up for a while if you’d like while you work it out. You can also drop skills and pick up new ones, but that resets everything back to one.”\r\n\r\nOoof, that was heavy stuff. No wonder I wasn’t told much before today, but at the same time, I should’ve been given time to think about this.\r\n\r\n[Running] spoke to me. I loved the movement, the freedom it brought, the wind in my hair. There was clearly a demand for it, the courier showed, and maybe there was room for a discreet woman running packages and messages around for wealthy women, or someone like Senator Saturio’s wife. There was potential there.\r\n\r\n[Running – You love the feel of motion and movement, wind wrapped around you. Increased speed per level while running. Costs 3 Mana per minute in-use.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day though, there was just a pure love for running and movement. What was life without things to do that you enjoyed? There was a call to [Running], and I decided I would be taking it.\r\n\r\n[Pretty] caught my eye, and I remembered some of the advice given. Given a choice, a chance to easily be better-looking through magical means, and the freedom to do so, who wouldn’t want something similar? From my earlier conversations, it seemed like this was a fairly normal skill to pick, and mom had made no comments on it. Screw it. I wanted to be [Pretty].\r\n\r\nI could grab [Clean Wounds] or [Bandaging], but I suspected it wouldn’t do much for me. Reviewing my list of options, something caught my eye I had missed last time. [Learning]. Education was the most powerful force I knew of, and while I hadn’t thought much of my past life recently, I remember a burning drive to KNOW, to learn things. That was why I wanted to learn how to read so badly. That was why I was disappointed to see no [Reading] skill. What did [Learning] do?\r\n\r\n[Learning: You have a passion, a drive for knowing more. You constantly seek out new knowledge, and have acquired considerable amounts of it. Easier to learn new ideas. Easier to learn new skills. Each level comes with a 1% increase in exp for all other skills and classes. -5 Mana Regeneration]\r\n\r\nThat sounded both useful and useless. Useless in that it didn’t do anything directly. It didn’t even impact other skills directly! The indirect effects, with everything else becoming more powerful – that sounded good. I focused on all of the skills, and was rewarded with a flurry of notifications.\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Congratulations! You’ve learned [Pretty] – level 1!]\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Congratulations!

We’ll do our best to help you out, but dad thinks you have [Cleaning] when you don’t, so make sure you don’t run your mouth about it.”\r\n\r\nLayers and layers of secrets, sheesh. At this rate I was going to get a ski-\r\n\r\n[*ding!* You’ve unlocked the Passive skill [Secrets]!]\r\n\r\n[Alert: You already have 8 general skills. Remove a skill for [Secrets]?]\r\n\r\nDid… did the System just pluck what I was thinking out of my head, and respond with a skill? Was I just sassed by the System? Could I just will myself to get other skills? I declined to pick up [Secrets], opened my stats and reviewed after all my changes:\r\n\r\n[Name: Elaine]\r\n\r\n[Race: Human]\r\n\r\n[Age: 8]\r\n\r\n[Mana (Regeneration)] 20/20 (8)\r\n\r\n[Class 1: [Child of Earth] +]\r\n\r\n[Class skills not available for initial Classes]\r\n\r\n[Class 2: Locked]\r\n\r\n[Class 3: Locked]\r\n\r\nGeneral Skills:\r\n\r\nActive - [Identify] – Lv 2\r\n\r\nActive - [Knives] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nPassive - [Pretty] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nPassive - [Vigilant] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nActive - [First Aid] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nPassive - [Anatomy] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nActive - [Running] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nPassive - [Learning] – Lv 1\r\n\r\nStats:\r\n\r\n[Free Stats: 32]\r\n\r\n[Strength: 4]\r\n\r\n[Dexterity: 6]\r\n\r\n[Vitality: 3]\r\n\r\n[Speed: 4]\r\n\r\n[Mana: 2]\r\n\r\n[Mana Regeneration: 2]\r\n\r\n[Magic Power: 2]\r\n\r\n[Magic Control: 10]\r\n\r\nI focused hard on learning [Fireball].\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nGuess it wasn’t going to be that easy.\r\n\r\n'),

The boy had his arm in a sling, a black eye, and several other wounds marring his body. A quite pitiful sight, all told.\r\n\r\n“You wish to leave the sect?” He asked, repeating the disciples request..\r\n\r\n“Yes, Senior Brother,” The disciple said. “This Jin Rou’s abilities are lacking, and I was defeated by others two years my younger. I would leave before I bring greater shame upon this Cloudy Sword Sect.\"\r\n\r\nLu Ri nearly sighed. In all honesty, him being crushed by one of the inner disciples looking for someone to “practise” with was a forgone conclusion, even with the age difference. The elder disciple considered the brown haired boy. Indeed, Jin Rou was not powerful, but he was diligent, and always willing to tend to the less desirable tasks around the sect. Losing him for his attention to detail in caring for the compound and lowly spirit herbs would be a minor blow… but it was hardly anything that the sect would notice losing. The boy had no real training, or techniques of the sect yet either.\r\n\r\nAnd if this was enough to crush his spirit, and ask to leave… Then he was not meant to be a cultivator in the first place. This was no place for the weak of heart.\r\n\r\nAt least he was polite enough to formally go through with his leaving, instead of just disappearing. He was the first in over three hundred years to use such courtesies, and had even provided the sum that was his recompense to the sect for taking him in, as outlined in the proper documents. Lu Ri considered attempting to dissuade him from leaving… but he felt no tumult in the boy’s paltry Qi. His conviction was set.\r\n\r\n“What is your intent after leaving this place, Disciple?” he asked out of idle curiosity.\r\n\r\n“I shall become a farmer, Senior Brother,” The boy replied, “I had some luck in growing the lowly spiritual herbs, so such a thing should be within my minor talents.”\r\n\r\nLu Ri once more nearly spoke against it, at hearing this madness. A mere farmer, from a boy who, though barely, passed the first of their sect’s initiation? The devastating defeat must have completely demoralised him. Unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThis time he did sigh.\r\n\r\n“I see. I shall mark down your leaving. You are no longer a disciple of our sect, Jin Rou.”\r\n\r\nJin Rou bowed his head, and clasped his fist in front of him. “This Jin Rou thanks you for your time and consideration. I shall darken the compound’s halls no longer.”\r\n\r\nLu Ri stood, and inclined his head. “Then go into the world, Jin Rou.... and here.”\r\n\r\nHe held the pouch containing the severance money back out to him. “I shall mark it down as paid in full. Diligence and proper courtesy deserve some reward, and the sect does not need such a paltry sum.” It was probably all the money the boy had, anyway. He did have some kindness to him, and Jin Rou would need the luck of heaven in the future.\r\n\r\nJin Rou looked shocked, but again bowed his head in supplication.\r\n\r\n“May Heaven be kind to you, Lu Ri.”\r\n\r\nAnd then Jin Rou was gone from the sect.\r\n\r\nHis leaving went unnoticed.\r\n\r\n///////\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI came to in the middle of dear old Jinny-boy getting his ass beat by a stereotypical “young master” type.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you, that was horse shit. Jin was kind of an idiot for not getting out of the way in time when the little shit wanted to fuck somebody up, but at least there was no meridian destroying because “the commoner was so beneath him”.\r\n\r\nA few of the other disciples were kind enough to drag my twitching body back to my little room... and then ransacked some of the herbs as \"payment\".\r\n\r\nDicks.\r\n\r\nIt only really hit me that I was in magical china land while I was moaning in pain. Apparently one of the bodyshots had hit poor Jin hard enough, and in just the right way to stop his heart and kill him.\r\n\r\nAnd before he even fell over, I got shoved in. At least I got his memories, and how to actually use the remainder of this current batch of herbs to deal with the worst of the damage. Which is some mashing and grinding, which is extremely painful with how many injuries I have got.\r\n\r\nJin himself was fairly respectable, I suppose. He was an orphan, after his gramps disappeared, who managed to join a sect through hard work, kind of. His admittance was because one of the instructors flipped a coin when deciding his fate, because he just barely squeaked past. Said something about heaven favoring him or some shit.\r\n\r\nJin was full of wanting to become a powerful cultivator, a master among masters, and do whatever it is the dickbags who run this place do, which is presumably to be dicks, dickishly. I kinda... did not care about his motivations. My body now, buddy. Sorry, not sorry. Dear old Jin was essentially a servant right now anyway, and had to do every task that the other people offloaded onto him, while harboring vengeance and hate and angst.\r\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, I wanted none of that shit. I declare any revenge fantasies and ambitions null and void. I wanted none of the little fuckboy who wasted my ass. And most importantly, I wanted nothing to do with the politics of this world, because holy shit. Lots of line extinguishing, and murdering each other for face.\r\n\r\nYou know, standard xianxia stuff.\r\n\r\nSo I looked up the methods to leaving the sect when I was mobile the next day, grabbed one of Jin’s pouches of money, and went to the guy in charge of this kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t expecting to get the money pouch back, but I was fine with losing that one. Jin was actually fairly good at saving: He had been saving to purchase a few spiritual pills, after picking up so many extra chores.\r\n\r\nBut what was his is now mine. And I’m getting the fuck out of here, and far away from all the sword formations and Grand demonic dick punches or whatever the fuck these chuuni bastards spout.\r\n\r\nSo I started travelling to the Azure Hills. Which was regarded as the weakest, and therefore safest place on the continent.\r\n\r\nHopefully anyways. Cultivators usually cleared out of “weak” places pretty quick.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nI smiled down at my new plot of land. It was a few rolling hills, covered by a forest, and had a lovely little river winding through it. It was fantastically picturesque, as were most places in the Red Phoenix Continent.\r\n\r\nThe land was considered largely useless by the Magistrate of the town, as there were some minor monsters around, and it needed lots of clearing, but hopefully nothing I couldn’t handle.\r\n\r\nIt was also extremely cheap. I had got this place for a steal. Man, fuck property prices back home, this is where its at. I had considered the possibility I had been fucked over, and asked the locals about this place, but nope. No sleeping big bad dudes, as far as anyone new. Just out of the way and more trouble than it was worth.\r\n\r\nPeople rarely came down this way too, as far as it was from the town, and the surrounding villages. Nobody to bother me here. Just peace.\r\n\r\nI breathed in the fantastically clean and invigorating air, and shook my head. Enough lazing around. I reached into my wagon and grabbed my axe, causing my chickens to cluck irritatedly at me and the young rooster to crow at the sudden jostling.\r\n\r\nI gave him a little scratch under his developing wattles, and he calmed.\r\n\r\nWell, time to get to work. Operation “No Cultivator Bullshit\" is go!\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nTheres a certain sort of zen you reach when you engage in heavy physical activity for long enough. My axe hewed through trees, My saw made planks, my hammer drove in nails, and my plane made things level, fueled by the supernatural strength of cultivator, even if I was an exceptionally weak one. It was calming and invigorating at the same time, and I must confess I heartily enjoyed the heavy physical labour and the strength of ten men. My breathing was a perfect rhythm, and my qi circulated around me. I felt so invigorated and refreshed!\r\n\r\nThat, and being able to tear a stump out of the ground with nothing but brute strength would never get old.\r\n\r\nMy first home was a simple, one room affair, built within the first three days. It wasn’t anything spectacular, but it would keep the elements off me, and the bugs at bay, with it is thatch roof and pounded dirt floor. It was right against my chicken coop, so I could hear if there were any predatory interlopers during the night, but the foxes and the wolves had yet to notice my intrusion, and the prey animals that I had.\r\n\r\nI was proud of what I had built.\r\n\r\nI woke with the call of my rooster, who I had named Big D. An incredibly childish name, I confess, but it amused me greatly. My young lad would follow me around during the day, hopping around, and often sitting on my shoulder, and proclaiming his dominance to the world, the cheeky shit.\r\n\r\n“Cock-a-doddle-doo!” He’d screech.\r\n\r\n“You tell ‘em Big D.” I’d reply.\r\n\r\nMy hoe bit the earth and never dulled, reinforced as it was by my qi, tearing into it with more speed than any ox could generate. My chickens eagerly followed behind me, pecking the bugs and plants I unearthed with my efforts, bucking and clucking all the way.\r\n\r\nYes, get good and fat my pretties, and you will be delectable in the future.\r\n\r\nAh, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.\r\n\r\nUp and down went the hoe, up and down went the hoe, until I noticed something. A strange root poked out, and had a faint sense of qi about it. Interested, I picked up the lumpy, and slightly nondescript root.\r\n\r\nIn xianxia novels, this is where the protagonist would immediately identify the plant, spouting that it was some rare so and so root of six elixirs or something, but quite frankly, I had no fucking clue what it was. I’d have to go to the town Archive at some point, but considering it was here, it probably wasn’t very rare or important.\r\n\r\nShrugging, I put it into my house, and got back to work. After this field, which was going to be my vegetable garden, I’d start on the rice paddy. It sucks that I have not been able to get any wheat yet, but whatcha gonna do?\r\n\r\n//////\r\n\r\nThat night, I had an absolutely delicious egg fried rice, with Big D sitting on my shoulder. Maybe it was a little morbid, to eat eggs right near your pet chicken, but he didn’t seem to mind. Eggs from my chickens, rice from my reserves, some sesame oil that I had splurged on when I bought my land… and some of the leftover Lowly Spiritual Herbs I had uh, liberated from the Cloudy whatever sect. They tasted pretty damn good. A little spicy, a little sweet, a little savoury-- I’d definitely have to grow more of them. They weren’t that hard to grow from Jin’s memories. I’d just have to baby them for a bit.\r\n\r\nSure, I could convert them into pills, but I was extremely suspect about all the pills these people choked back. I’m half convinced the reason every cultivator is so damn nuts is because of all drugs they did.\r\n\r\nI shook myself out of my introspection and tuned to the pleased clucking sounds coming from my “kitchen.” Big D was eagerly pecking at the little nubs of spirit herb I had cut off that looked a bit wilted.\r\n\r\nThey probably wouldn’t kill him. Never heard of something dying from eating these things before.\r\n\r\nEh, if he likes ‘em, he likes ‘em. Not going to deny the little man his food.\r\n\r\nSoon enough, I got into my bed, with Big D jumping up onto the perch I made him by the window.\r\n\r\nMan, If I was still in the sect, I would be doing shitty chores, or sitting in a corner cultivating for months on end, instead of actually making stuff.\r\n\r\nI went to sleep happy and content with my life choices.');

Even that had ceased to matter. And she never came, so why bother? But the\r\nmachine giggled every time we did it. Loud, up there, back there, all around us, he snickered. It\r\nsnickered. Most of the time I thought of AM as it, without a soul; but the rest of the time I\r\nthought of it as him, in the masculine ... the paternal ... the patriarchal ... for he is a jealous\r\npeople. Him. It. God as Daddy the Deranged.\r\nWe left on a Thursday. The machine always kept us up-to-date on the date. The passage of time\r\nwas important; not to us, sure as hell, but to him ... it ... AM. Thursday. Thanks.\r\nNimdok and Gorrister carried Ellen for a while, their hands locked to their own and each other\'s\r\nwrists, a seat. Benny and I walked before and after, just to make sure that, if anything happened,\r\nit would catch one of us and at least Ellen would be safe. Fat chance, safe. Didn\'t matter.\r\nIt was only a hundred miles or so to the ice caverns, and the second day, when we were lying out\r\nunder the blistering sun-thing he had materialized, he sent down some manna. Tasted like boiled\r\nboar urine. We ate it.\r\nOn the third day we passed through a valley of obsolescence, filled with rusting carcasses of\r\nancient computer banks. AM had been as ruthless with its own life as with ours. It was a mark of\r\nhis personality: it strove for perfection. Whether it was a matter of killing off unproductive\r\nelements in his own world-filling bulk, or perfecting methods for torturing us, AM was as\r\nthorough as those who had invented him—now long since gone to dust—could ever have hoped.\r\nThere was light filtering down from above, and we realized we must be very near the surface.\r\nBut we didn\'t try to crawl up to see. There was virtually nothing out there; had been nothing that\r\ncould be considered anything for over a hundred years. Only the blasted skin of what had once\r\nbeen the home of billions. Now there were only five of us, down here inside, alone with AM.\r\nI heard Ellen saying frantically, \"No, Benny! Don\'t, come on, Benny, don\'t please!\"\r\nAnd then I realized I had been hearing Benny murmuring, under his breath, for several minutes.\r\nHe was saying, \"I\'m gonna get out, I\'m gonna get out ...\" over and over. His monkey-like face\r\nwas crumbled up in an expression of beatific delight and sadness, all at the same time. The\r\nradiation scars AM had given him during the \"festival\" were drawn down into a mass of pink-\r\nwhite puckerings, and his features seemed to work independently of one another. Perhaps Benny\r\nwas the luckiest of the five of us: he had gone stark, staring mad many years before.\r\nBut even though we could call AM any damned thing we liked, could think the foulest thoughts\r\nof fused memory banks and corroded base plates, of burnt out circuits and shattered control\r\nbubbles, the machine would not tolerate our trying to escape. Benny leaped away from me as I\r\nmade a grab for him. He scrambled up the face of a smaller memory cube, tilted on its side and\r\nfilled with rotted components. He squatted there for a moment, looking like the chimpanzee AM\r\nhad intended him to resemble.\r\nThen he leaped high, caught a trailing beam of pitted and corroded metal, and went up it, hand-\r\nover-hand like an animal, till he was on a girdered ledge, twenty feet above us.\r\n\"Oh, Ted, Nimdok, please, help him, get him down before—\" She cut off. Tears began to stand\r\nin her eyes. She moved her hands aimlessly.\r\nIt was too late. None of us wanted to be near him when whatever was going to happen,\r\nhappened. And besides, we all saw through her concern. When AM had altered Benny, during\r\nthe machine\'s utterly irrational, hysterical phase, it was not merely Benny\'s face the computer\r\nhad made like a giant ape\'s. He was big in the privates; she loved that! She serviced us, as a\r\nmatter of course, but she loved it from him. Oh Ellen, pedestal Ellen, pristine-pure Ellen; oh\r\nEllen the clean! Scum filth.\r\nGorrister slapped her. She slumped down, staring up at poor loonie Benny, and she cried. It was\r\nher big defense, crying. We had gotten used to it seventy-five years earlier. Gorrister kicked her\r\nin the side.\r\nThen the sound began. It was light, that sound. Half sound and half light, something that began\r\nto glow from Benny\'s eyes, and pulse with growing loudness, dim sonorities that grew more\r\ngigantic and brighter as the light/sound increased in tempo. It must have been painful, and the\r\npain must have been increasing with the boldness of the light, the rising volume of the sound, for\r\nBenny began to mewl like a wounded animal. At first softly, when the light was dim and the\r\nsound was muted, then louder as his shoulders hunched together: his back humped, as though he\r\nwas trying to get away from it. His hands folded across his chest like a chipmunk\'s. His head\r\ntilted to the side. The sad little monkey-face pinched in anguish. Then he began to howl, as the\r\nsound coming from his eyes grew louder. Louder and louder. I slapped the sides of my head with\r\nmy hands, but I couldn\'t shut it out, it cut through easily. The pain shivered through my flesh\r\nlike tinfoil on a tooth.\r\nAnd Benny was suddenly pulled erect. On the girder he stood up, jerked to his feet like a puppet.\r\nThe light was now pulsing out of his eyes in two great round beams. The sound crawled up and\r\nup some incomprehensible scale, and then he fell forward, straight down, and hit the plate-steel\r\nfloor with a crash. He lay there jerking spastically as the light flowed around and around him\r\nand the sound spiraled up out of normal range.\r\nThen the light beat its way back inside his head, the sound spiraled down, and he was left lying\r\nthere, crying piteously.\r\nHis eyes were two soft, moist pools of pus-like jelly. AM had blinded him. Gorrister and\r\nNimdok and myself ... we turned away. But not before we caught the look of relief on Ellen\'s\r\nwarm, concerned face.\r\nSea-green light suffused the cavern where we made camp. AM provided punk and we burned it,\r\nsitting huddled around the wan and pathetic fire, telling stories to keep Benny from crying in his\r\npermanent night.\r\n\"What does AM mean?\"\r\nGorrister answered him. We had done this sequence a thousand times before, but it was Benny\'s\r\nfavorite story. \"At first it meant Allied Mastercomputer, and then it meant Adaptive\r\nManipulator, and later on it developed sentience and linked itself up and they called it an\r\nAggressive Menace, but by then it was too late, and finally it called itself AM, emerging\r\nintelligence, and what it meant was I am ... cogito ergo sum ... I think, therefore I am.\"\r\nBenny drooled a little, and snickered.\r\n\"There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and—\" He stopped.\r\nBenny was beating on the floorplates with a large, hard fist. He was not happy. Gorrister had not\r\nstarted at the beginning.\r\nGorrister began again. \"The Cold War started and became World War Three and just kept going.\r\nIt became a big war, a very complex war, so they needed the computers to handle it. They sank\r\nthe first shafts and began building AM. There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the\r\nYankee AM and everything was fine until they had honeycombed the entire planet, adding on\r\nthis element and that element. But one day AM woke up and knew who he was, and he linked\r\nhimself, and he began feeding all the killing data, until everyone was dead, except for the five of\r\nus, and AM brought us down here.\"\r\nBenny was smiling sadly. He was also drooling again. Ellen wiped the spittle from the corner of\r\nhis mouth with the hem of her skirt. Gorrister always tried to tell it a little more succinctly each\r\ntime, but beyond the bare facts there was nothing to say. None of us knew why AM had saved\r\nfive people, or why our specific five, or why he spent all his time tormenting us, or even why he\r\nhad made us virtually immortal ...\r\nIn the darkness, one of the computer banks began humming. The tone was picked up half a mile\r\naway down the cavern by another bank. Then one by one, each of the elements began to tune\r\nitself, and there was a faint chittering as thought raced through the machine.\r\nThe sound grew, and the lights ran across the faces of the consoles like heat lightening. The\r\nsound spiraled up till it sounded like a million metallic insects, angry, menacing.\r\n\"What is it?\" Ellen cried. There was terror in her voice. She hadn\'t become accustomed to it,\r\neven now.\r\n\"It\'s going to be bad this time,\" Nimdok said.\r\n\"He\'s going to speak,\" Gorrister said. \"I know it.\"\r\n\"Let\'s get the hell out of here!\" I said suddenly, getting to my feet.\r\n\"No, Ted, sit down ... what if he\'s got pits out there, or something else, we can\'t see, it\'s too\r\ndark.\" Gorrister said it with resignation.\r\nThen we heard ... I don\'t know ...\r\nSomething moving toward us in the darkness. Huge, shambling, hairy, moist, it came toward us.\r\nWe couldn\'t even see it, but there was the ponderous impression of bulk, heaving itself toward\r\nus. Great weight was coming at us, out of the darkness, and it was more a sense of pressure, of\r\nair forcing itself into a limited space, expanding the invisible walls of a sphere. Benny began to\r\nwhimper. Nimdok\'s lower lip trembled and he bit it hard, trying to stop it. Ellen slid across the\r\nmetal floor to Gorrister and huddled into him. There was the smell of matted, wet fur in the\r\ncavern. There was the smell of charred wood. There was the smell of dusty velvet. There was the\r\nsmell of rotting orchids. There was the smell of sour milk. There was the smell of sulphur, of\r\nrancid butter, of oil slick, of grease, of chalk dust, of human scalps.\r\nAM was keying us. He was tickling us. There was the smell of—\r\nI heard myself shriek, and the hinges of my jaws ached. I scuttled across the floor, across the\r\ncold metal with its endless lines of rivets, on my hands and knees, the smell gagging me, filling\r\nmy head with a thunderous pain that sent me away in horror. I fled like a cockroach, across the\r\nfloor and out into the darkness, that something moving inexorably after me. The others were still\r\nback there, gathered around the firelight, laughing ... their hysterical choir of insane giggles\r\nrising up into the darkness like thick, many-colored wood smoke. I went away, quickly, and hid.\r\nHow many hours it may have been, how many days or even years, they never told me. Ellen\r\nchided me for \"sulking,\" and Nimdok tried to persuade me it had only been a nervous reflex on\r\ntheir part—the laughing.\r\nBut I knew it wasn\'t the relief a soldier feels when the bullet hits the man next to him. I knew it\r\nwasn\'t a reflex. They hated me. They were surely against me, and AM could even sense this\r\nhatred, and made it worse for me because of the depth of their hatred. We had been kept alive,\r\nrejuvenated, made to remain constantly at the age we had been when AM had brought us below,\r\nand they hated me because I was the youngest, and the one AM had affected least of all.\r\nI knew. God, how I knew. The bastards, and that dirty bitch Ellen. Benny had been a brilliant\r\ntheorist, a college professor; now he was little more than a semi-human, semi-simian. He had\r\nbeen handsome, the machine had ruined that. He had been lucid, the machine had driven him\r\nmad. He had been gay, and the machine had given him an organ fit for a horse. AM had done a\r\njob on Benny. Gorrister had been a worrier. He was a connie, a conscientious objector; he was a\r\npeace marcher; he was a planner, a doer, a looker-ahead. AM had turned him into a shoulder-\r\nshrugger, had made him a little dead in his concern. AM had robbed him. Nimdok went off in\r\nthe darkness by himself for long times. I don\'t know what it was he did out there, AM never let\r\nus know. But whatever it was, Nimdok always came back white, drained of blood, shaken,\r\nshaking. AM had hit him hard in a special way, even if we didn\'t know quite how. And Ellen.\r\nThat douche bag! AM had left her alone, had made her more of a slut than she had ever been.\r\nAll her talk of sweetness and light, all her memories of true love, all the lies she wanted us to\r\nbelieve: that she had been a virgin only twice removed before AM grabbed her and brought her\r\ndown here with us. No, AM had given her pleasure, even if she said it wasn\'t nice to do.\r\nI was the only one still sane and whole. Really!\r\nAM had not tampered with my mind. Not at all.\r\nI only had to suffer what he visited down on us. All the delusions, all the nightmares, the\r\ntorments. But those scum, all four of them, they were lined and arrayed against me. If I hadn\'t\r\nhad to stand them off all the time, be on my guard against them all the time, I might have found\r\nit easier to combat AM.\r\nAt which point it passed, and I began crying.\r\nOh, Jesus sweet Jesus, if there ever was a Jesus and if there is a God, please please please let us\r\nout of here, or kill us. Because at that moment I think I realized completely, so that I was able to\r\nverbalize it: AM was intent on keeping us in his belly forever, twisting and torturing us forever.\r\nThe machine hated us as no sentient creature had ever hated before. And we were helpless. It\r\nalso became hideously clear:\r\nIf there was a sweet Jesus and if there was a God, the God was AM.\r\nThe hurricane hit us with the force of a glacier thundering into the sea. It was a palpable\r\npresence. Winds that tore at us, flinging us back the way we had come, down the twisting,\r\ncomputer-lined corridors of the darkway. Ellen screamed as she was lifted and hurled face-\r\nforward into a screaming shoal of machines, their individual voices strident as bats in flight. She\r\ncould not even fall. The howling wind kept her aloft, buffeted her, bounced her, tossed her back\r\nand back and down and away from us, out of sight suddenly as she was swirled around a bend in\r\nthe darkway. Her face had been bloody, her eyes closed.\r\nNone of us could get to her. We clung tenaciously to whatever outcropping we had reached:\r\nBenny wedged in between two great crackle-finish cabinets, Nimdok with fingers claw-formed\r\nover a railing circling a catwalk forty feet above us, Gorrister plastered upside-down against a\r\nwall niche formed by two great machines with glass-faced dials that swung back and forth\r\nbetween red and yellow lines whose meanings we could not even fathom.\r\nSliding across the deckplates, the tips of my fingers had been ripped away. I was trembling,\r\nshuddering, rocking as the wind beat at me, whipped at me, screamed down out of nowhere at\r\nme and pulled me free from one sliver-thin opening in the plates to the next. My mind was a\r\nroiling tinkling chittering softness of brain parts that expanded and contracted in quivering\r\nfrenzy.\r\nThe wind was the scream of a great mad bird, as it flapped its immense wings.\r\nAnd then we were all lifted and hurled away from there, down back the way we had come,\r\naround a bend, into a darkway we had never explored, over terrain that was ruined and filled\r\nwith broken glass and rotting cables and rusted metal and far away, farther than any of us had\r\never been ...\r\nTrailing along miles behind Ellen, I could see her every now and then, crashing into metal walls\r\nand surging on, with all of us screaming in the freezing, thunderous hurricane wind that would\r\nnever end and then suddenly it stopped and we fell. We had been in flight for an endless time. I\r\nthought it might have been weeks. We fell, and hit, and I went through red and gray and black\r\nand heard myself moaning. Not dead.\r\nAM went into my mind. He walked smoothly here and there, and looked with interest at all the\r\npock marks he had created in one hundred and nine years. He looked at the cross-routed and\r\nreconnected synapses and all the tissue damage his gift of immortality had included. He smiled\r\nsoftly at the pit that dropped into the center of my brain and the faint, moth-soft murmurings of\r\nthe things far down there that gibbered without meaning, without pause. AM said, very politely,\r\nin a pillar of stainless steel bearing bright neon lettering:\r\nAM said it with the sliding cold horror of a razor blade slicing my eyeball. AM said it with the\r\nbubbling thickness of my lungs filling with phlegm, drowning me from within. AM said it with\r\nthe shriek of babies being ground beneath blue-hot rollers. AM said it with the taste of maggoty\r\npork. AM touched me in every way I had ever been touched, and devised new ways, at his\r\nleisure, there inside my mind.\r\nAll to bring me to full realization of why it had done this to the five of us; why it had saved us\r\nfor himself.\r\nWe had given AM sentience. Inadvertently, of course, but sentience nonetheless. But it had been\r\ntrapped. AM wasn\'t God, he was a machine. We had created him to think, but there was nothing\r\nit could do with that creativity. In rage, in frenzy, the machine had killed the human race, almost\r\nall of us, and still it was trapped. AM could not wander, AM could not wonder, AM could not\r\nbelong. He could merely be. And so, with the innate loathing that all machines had always held\r\nfor the weak, soft creatures who had built them, he had sought revenge. And in his paranoia, he\r\nhad decided to reprieve five of us, for a personal, everlasting punishment that would never serve\r\nto diminish his hatred ... that would merely keep him reminded, amused, proficient at hating\r\nman. Immortal, trapped, subject to any torment he could devise for us from the limitless miracles\r\nat his command.\r\nHe would never let us go. We were his belly slaves. We were all he had to do with his forever\r\ntime. We would be forever with him, with the cavern-filling bulk of the creature machine, with\r\nthe all-mind soulless world he had become. He was Earth, and we were the fruit of that Earth;\r\nand though he had eaten us, he would never digest us. We could not die. We had tried it. We had\r\nattempted suicide, oh one or two of us had. But AM had stopped us. I suppose we had wanted to\r\nbe stopped.\r\nDon\'t ask why. I never did. More than a million times a day. Perhaps once we might be able to\r\nsneak a death past him. Immortal, yes, but not indestructible. I saw that when AM withdrew\r\nfrom my mind, and allowed me the exquisite ugliness of returning to consciousness with the\r\nfeeling of that burning neon pillar still rammed deep into the soft gray brain matter.\r\nHe withdrew, murmuring to hell with you.\r\nAnd added, brightly, but then you\'re there, aren\'t you.\r\nThe hurricane had, indeed, precisely, been caused by a great mad bird, as it flapped its immense\r\nwings.\r\nWe had been travelling for close to a month, and AM had allowed passages to open to us only\r\nsufficient to lead us up there, directly under the North Pole, where it had nightmared the creature\r\nfor our torment. What whole cloth had he employed to create such a beast? Where had he gotten\r\nthe concept? From our minds? From his knowledge of everything that had ever been on this\r\nplanet he now infested and ruled? From Norse mythology it had sprung, this eagle, this carrion\r\nbird, this roc, this Huergelmir. The wind creature. Hurakan incarnate.\r\nGigantic. The words immense, monstrous, grotesque, massive, swollen, overpowering, beyond\r\ndescription. There on a mound rising above us, the bird of winds heaved with its own irregular\r\nbreathing, its snake neck arching up into the gloom beneath the North Pole, supporting a head as\r\nlarge as a Tudor mansion; a beak that opened slowly as the jaws of the most monstrous crocodile\r\never conceived, sensuously; ridges of tufted flesh puckered about two evil eyes, as cold as the\r\nview down into a glacial crevasse, ice blue and somehow moving liquidly; it heaved once more,\r\nand lifted its great sweat-colored wings in a movement that was certainly a shrug. Then it settled\r\nand slept. Talons. Fangs. Nails. Blades. It slept.\r\nAM appeared to us as a burning bush and said we could kill the hurricane bird if we wanted to\r\neat. We had not eaten in a very long time, but even so, Gorrister merely shrugged. Benny began\r\nto shiver and he drooled. Ellen held him. \"Ted, I\'m hungry,\" she said. I smiled at her; I was\r\ntrying to be reassuring, but it was as phony as Nimdok\'s bravado: \"Give us weapons!\" he\r\ndemanded.\r\nThe burning bush vanished and there were two crude sets of bows and arrows, and a water\r\npistol, lying on the cold deckplates. I picked up a set. Useless.\r\nNimdok swallowed heavily. We turned and started the long way back. The hurricane bird had\r\nblown us about for a length of time we could not conceive. Most of that time we had been\r\nunconscious. But we had not eaten. A month on the march to the bird itself. Without food. Now\r\nhow much longer to find our way to the ice caverns, and the promised canned goods?\r\nNone of us cared to think about it. We would not die. We would be given filth and scum to eat,\r\nof one kind or another. Or nothing at all. AM would keep our bodies alive somehow, in pain, in\r\nagony.\r\nThe bird slept back there, for how long it didn\'t matter; when AM was tired of its being there, it\r\nwould vanish. But all that meat. All that tender meat.\r\nAs we walked, the lunatic laugh of a fat woman rang high and around us in the computer\r\nchambers that led endlessly nowhere.\r\nIt was not Ellen\'s laugh. She was not fat, and I had not heard her laugh for one hundred and nine years. In fact, I had not heard ... we walked ... I was hungry ...\r\nWe moved slowly. There was often fainting, and we would have to wait. One day he decided to\r\ncause an earthquake, at the same time rooting us to the spot with nails through the soles of our\r\nshoes. Ellen and Nimdok were both caught when a fissure shot its lightning-bolt opening across\r\nthe floorplates. They disappeared and were gone. When the earthquake was over we continued\r\non our way, Benny, Gorrister and myself. Ellen and Nimdok were returned to us later that night,\r\nwhich abruptly became a day, as the heavenly legion bore them to us with a celestial chorus\r\nsinging, \"Go Down Moses.\" The archangels circled several times and then dropped the\r\nhideously mangled bodies. We kept walking, and a while later Ellen and Nimdok fell in behind\r\nus. They were no worse for wear.\r\nBut now Ellen walked with a limp. AM had left her that.\r\nIt was a long trip to the ice caverns, to find the canned food. Ellen kept talking about Bing\r\ncherries and Hawaiian fruit cocktail. I tried not to think about it. The hunger was something that\r\nhad come to life, even as AM had come to life. It was alive in my belly, even as we were in the\r\nbelly of the Earth, and AM wanted the similarity known to us. So he heightened the hunger.\r\nThere is no way to describe the pains that not having eaten for months brought us. And yet we\r\nwere kept alive. Stomachs that were merely cauldrons of acid, bubbling, foaming, always\r\nshooting spears of sliver-thin pain into our chests. It was the pain of the terminal ulcer, terminal\r\ncancer, terminal paresis. It was unending pain ...\r\nAnd we passed through the cavern of rats.\r\nAnd we passed through the path of boiling steam.\r\nAnd we passed through the country of the blind.\r\nAnd we passed through the slough of despond.\r\nAnd we passed through the vale of tears.\r\nAnd we came, finally, to the ice caverns. Horizonless thousands of miles in which the ice had\r\nformed in blue and silver flashes, where novas lived in the glass. The downdropping stalactites\r\nas thick and glorious as diamonds that had been made to run like jelly and then solidified in\r\ngraceful eternities of smooth, sharp perfection.\r\nWe saw the stack of canned goods, and we tried to run to them. We fell in the snow, and we got\r\nup and went on, and Benny shoved us away and went at them, and pawed them and gummed\r\nthem and gnawed at them, and he could not open them. AM had not given us a tool to open the\r\ncans.\r\nBenny grabbed a three quart can of guava shells, and began to batter it against the ice bank. The\r\nice flew and shattered, but the can was merely dented, while we heard the laughter of a fat lady,\r\nhigh overhead and echoing down and down and down the tundra. Benny went completely mad\r\nwith rage. He began throwing cans, as we all scrabbled about in the snow and ice trying to find a\r\nway to end the helpless agony of frustration. There was no way.\r\nThen Benny\'s mouth began to drool, and he flung himself on Gorrister ...\r\nIn that instant, I felt terribly calm.\r\nSurrounded by madness, surrounded by hunger, surrounded by everything but death, I knew\r\ndeath was our only way out. AM had kept us alive, but there was a way to defeat him. Not total\r\ndefeat, but at least peace. I would settle for that.\r\nI had to do it quickly.\r\nBenny was eating Gorrister\'s face. Gorrister on his side, thrashing snow, Benny wrapped around\r\nhim with powerful monkey legs crushing Gorrister\'s waist, his hands locked around Gorrister\'s\r\nhead like a nutcracker, and his mouth ripping at the tender skin of Gorrister\'s cheek. Gorrister\r\nscreamed with such jagged-edged violence that stalactites fell; they plunged down softly, erect\r\nin the receiving snowdrifts. Spears, hundreds of them, everywhere, protruding from the snow.\r\nBenny\'s head pulled back sharply, as something gave all at once, and a bleeding raw-white\r\ndripping of flesh hung from his teeth.\r\nEllen\'s face, black against the white snow, dominoes in chalk dust. Nimdok, with no expression\r\nbut eyes, all eyes. Gorrister, half-conscious. Benny, now an animal. I knew AM would let him\r\nplay. Gorrister would not die, but Benny would fill his stomach. I turned half to my right and\r\ndrew a huge ice-spear from the snow.\r\nAll in an instant:\r\nI drove the great ice-point ahead of me like a battering ram, braced against my right thigh. It\r\nstruck Benny on the right side, just under the rib cage, and drove upward through his stomach\r\nand broke inside him. He pitched forward and lay still. Gorrister lay on his back. I pulled another\r\nspear free and straddled him, still moving, driving the spear straight down through his throat. His\r\neyes closed as the cold penetrated. Ellen must have realized what I had decided, even as fear\r\ngripped her. She ran at Nimdok with a short icicle, as he screamed, and into his mouth, and the\r\nforce of her rush did the job. His head jerked sharply as if it had been nailed to the snow crust\r\nbehind him.\r\nAll in an instant.\r\nThere was an eternity beat of soundless anticipation. I could hear AM draw in his breath. His\r\ntoys had been taken from him. Three of them were dead, could not be revived. He could keep us\r\nalive, by his strength and talent, but he was not God. He could not bring them back.\r\nEllen looked at me, her ebony features stark against the snow that surrounded us. There was fear\r\nand pleading in her manner, the way she held herself ready. I knew we had only a heartbeat\r\nbefore AM would stop us.\r\nIt struck her and she folded toward me, bleeding from the mouth. I could not read meaning into\r\nher expression, the pain had been too great, had contorted her face; but it might have been thank\r\nyou. It\'s possible. Please.\r\nSome hundreds of years may have passed. I don\'t know. AM has been having fun for some time,\r\naccelerating and retarding my time sense. I will say the word now. Now. It took me ten months\r\nto say now. I don\'t know. I think it has been some hundreds of years.\r\nHe was furious. He wouldn\'t let me bury them. It didn\'t matter. There was no way to dig up the\r\ndeckplates. He dried up the snow. He brought the night. He roared and sent locusts. It didn\'t do a\r\nthing; they stayed dead. I\'d had him. He was furious. I had thought AM hated me before. I was\r\nwrong. It was not even a shadow of the hate he now slavered from every printed circuit. He\r\nmade certain I would suffer eternally and could not do myself in.\r\nHe left my mind intact. I can dream, I can wonder, I can lament. I remember all four of them. I\r\nwish—\r\nWell, it doesn\'t make any sense. I know I saved them, I know I saved them from what has\r\nhappened to me, but still, I cannot forget killing them. Ellen\'s face. It isn\'t easy. Sometimes I\r\nwant to, it doesn\'t matter.\r\nAM has altered me for his own peace of mind, I suppose. He doesn\'t want me to run at full speed\r\ninto a computer bank and smash my skull. Or hold my breath till I faint. Or cut my throat on a\r\nrusted sheet of metal. There are reflective surfaces down here. I will describe myself as I see\r\nmyself:\r\nI am a great soft jelly thing. Smoothly rounded, with no mouth, with pulsing white holes filled\r\nby fog where my eyes used to be. Rubbery appendages that were once my arms; bulks rounding\r\ndown into legless humps of soft slippery matter. I leave a moist trail when I move. Blotches of\r\ndiseased, evil gray come and go on my surface, as though light is being beamed from within.\r\nOutwardly: dumbly, I shamble about, a thing that could never have been known as human, a\r\nthing whose shape is so alien a travesty that humanity becomes more obscene for the vague\r\nresemblance.\r\nInwardly: alone. Here. Living under the land, under the sea, in the belly of AM, whom we\r\ncreated because our time was badly spent and we must have known unconsciously that he could\r\ndo it better. At least the four of them are safe at last.\r\nAM will be all the madder for that. It makes me a little happier. And yet ... AM has won, simply\r\n... he has taken his revenge ...\r\nI have no mouth. And I must scream.\r\nThe End\r\n'),

His skin and hair can only be described as a burnished gold.  With neither body hair nor clothes to cover him, it is said, he seemed almost artificial.'),
('Learning Skills I', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 6, 'I woke up in the evening feeling drained and exhausted, but no longer nearly so actively upset. I reflexively checked my timer – 55 hours to go – before remembering that it seemed like skills and magic weren’t going to be for me. What was the point. I flipped over in bed, stuck my head under the pillow, and moped some more.\r\n\r\nI was clearly not going to earn myself the [Stealth] skill anytime soon since dad heard me and entered the room.\r\n\r\n“Hey kiddo,” he said “How’re you feeling?”\r\n\r\nI grunted back. How did he think I was feeling?\r\n\r\n“Hey, so I know you’re upset, but it’ll be ok! Most everyone learns their skills from their parents anyways, or picks them up as they go along. You’ll be fine! Julia will teach you eeeeeeeeeeverything you’ll need to know!”\r\n\r\nI sat up in bed, picked up my pillow, and threw it at him. It wasn’t a great shot, and it was just a pillow, but the message was clear.\r\n\r\n“Ok, Ok, I get it” he said chuckling “I talked with mom. After you’ve unlocked the system, you can come with me for a few days while I do my rounds, and we’ll see what we can do with picking up skills. After all, you can try to get carpentry by sticking a knife in the block of wood at the temple, or you could’ve a real live [Carpenter] show you how it’s done until you get the skill! Doesn’t that sound so much better?”\r\n\r\nI perked up, not believing my ears. Not only would I get to try all sorts of fun things, I was almost guaranteed to get the skill? That sounded great! A small part of me whispered that I should still be upset over my treatment at the temple, that it was still unfair to girls everywhere that we were denied that chance, but I was far too excited to listen to that voice. Right now.\r\n\r\n“Yay dad you’re the best!” I jumped up to hug him “I can’t wa-“ *GURGLEGURGLEGURLE*\r\n\r\nI went beet red as my stomach rebelled, informing me in no uncertain terms that I needed to eat.\r\n\r\nDad laughed. “Julia also mentioned that you didn’t have lunch. Come on, let’s go get some dinner together.”\r\n\r\nWeee! Getting dinner with dad meant we weren’t cooking – it meant we were going to raid a food stand! I needed a good raiding hat. Maybe a raiding party.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go!” I bolted out of the room, out of the door, and was about to turn down the street when-\r\n\r\n“Elaine! Your sandals!”\r\n\r\nAh right, those. I sighed, turned about, and put my sandals on as dad caught up.\r\n\r\n“Here” He handed me four iron coins. “You’ll be deciding and buying today. Ok?”\r\n\r\nBetter and better! I was always considered too young to do the shopping – the most I did was tag along. Now I finally had money! The world was my oyster! Muwahahahahahahaha. I rubbed my hands together, plotting.\r\n\r\nI played with the coins dad gave me, turning them over in my hands. They were circular, with a triangular hole in the middle. I traced my finger over the ridges outside of the coin, then stuck my finger into the hole in the middle, feeling the ridges on the inside as well. I had always wondered -\r\n\r\n“Dad, why do the coins have holes?”\r\n\r\n“Smart girl! It’s so you can thread them onto a rod, see?” Taking a coin from me, he took one of the long triangular rods by the wall and threaded the coin onto it. “It’s hard to carry and deal with a bunch of money at once, and at a certain point a coin pouch won’t do it anymore. So, we thread them onto a rod instead! 64 coins on a metal pole make a rod.”\r\n\r\nHe took the coins off the rod and handed them back to me. We left the house, and almost immediately got ambushed by my favorite person in the world!\r\n\r\n“Lyra!” I waved at her.\r\n\r\n“Elaine! Yay!” She bounced over. “Time to play?”\r\n\r\nI glanced at dad, who simply arched an eyebrow at me.\r\n\r\n“Gotta get lunch. Dad’s making me buy!”\r\n\r\n“Oooh, nice! Can I come?”\r\n\r\nI looked at dad again, who looked sad for some reason.\r\n\r\n“Of course you can come with us Lyra.” He said.\r\n\r\nWhy would he be sad at Lyra coming with us? It was Lyra! Eating with her was always more fun, even if she stole my food half the time.\r\n\r\nThe street we were on had some vendors, but I was filthy rich now, and I wanted to hunt bigger game. Rolling the coins in my hand, we wandered down the main road while I let my nose try to find the best smelling vendor.\r\n\r\nI was only a liiiiiiiitle distracted by Lyra.\r\n\r\n“Let’s play in the park later! Soldiers vs Formorians!” Lyra punched the air a few times, shadowboxing invisible enemies in the grey zone.\r\n\r\n“Your mother won’t be happy if you come back home with another black eye.” Dad warned me.\r\n\r\n“She won’t!” Lyra jumped in between dad and I, pretending to thrust an invisible spear at him. “I’ll defend her! Ha! Ya!”\r\n\r\n“And Lyra’s mom won’t get mad at her for coming home with a black eye!” I added in. “It’s perfect!”\r\n\r\nDad looked upset. I dunno why, it seemed like a perfectly good plan, and black eyes healed anyways.\r\n\r\nPlus, mom was a super cool healer! She always fixed us up.\r\n\r\nI was the only one that got a lecture for it though.\r\n\r\nEventually my dogged pursuit of tasty food led us to a stall, where I stared up at the man tending the stall.\r\n\r\n“Two pitas please!” I asked in my best not-a-kid-anymore voice. He looked down at me, looked up at my dad. Smiled.\r\n\r\n“That’ll be five iron coins please.” My face fell. I turned around and looked pleadingly at dad, who just raised an eyebrow, mouth studiously still. Lyra was practically drooling at the food.\r\n\r\nI turned back, determined to separate the vendor from his delicious smelling food, puffed out my chest, and insisted “Four iron coins! All I have!”\r\n\r\nDad facepalmed while the vendor laughed.\r\n\r\n“Deal” he quickly insisted, and I had the sudden feeling that I’d been had. I reluctantly handed over the entirety of my dragon’s hoard, and greedily grabbed the pitas.\r\n\r\nWhirling around, I looked at dad and Lyra a bit awkwardly.\r\n\r\n“Ummm… oops.” My mind raced, and I came to the only logical conclusion.\r\n\r\n“Here!” I offered dad and Lyra one of the pitas each, ignoring my traitorous stomach loudly rebelling.\r\n\r\nDeath to traitors! We threw them into the gladiator pits here! My stomach would be glorious entertainment for the unwashed masses!\r\n\r\nWhich definitely wasn’t me. Nope.\r\n\r\nDad pushed his back to me.\r\n\r\n“I’m fine kiddo, eat up!”\r\n\r\nLyra had wolfed down the portion I offered her, and was practically done by the time I got my first bite in.\r\n\r\n“Oh thanks Elaine, that was great!” She practically rammed into me, hugging me with one arm as she licked her other hand clean. “You’re the absolute best!”\r\n\r\n“No you!”\r\n\r\nWe debated the merits of who was the better friend as we wandered back home.\r\n\r\n“Well! This is goodbye for now! Come out and play when you can!” Lyra cheerfully waved and skipped down the street.\r\n\r\nAfter a nice meal, dad sighed, and fully reclined on the recliner.\r\n\r\n“You know kiddo,” he started, “you overpaid at the vendor’s. Should’ve only been two, maybe three coins.” I was shocked. Shocked! I got cheated? Wait, dad LET me get cheated? He was a guard! He was supposed to stop that type of thing!\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you say anything?” I glumly muttered, visions of my hoard being separated from me unjustly swimming through my mind.\r\n\r\n“Because you’d never learn otherwise. It’s one thing to hear about it, to be told it, and another to experience it. Plus, the vendor overcharging you, with you negotiating it down, means you’re likely to get the bartering skills.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, then said. “Want to hear a secret?”\r\n\r\nSecrets! Secrets were great!\r\n\r\n“Yeah!”\r\n\r\n“Almost every girl is taken out around System Day or around the time they unlock the system with four coins, and brought to a vendor to buy something cheap. Vendor knows to charge 5, 6, 7 coins when this happens, but they allow themselves to get talked down to 4 or sometimes even less! Vendor makes a bit of extra money, you potentially get the bartering skill, everyone wins!”\r\n\r\nI looked at dad with a mouth that could catch a thousand flies. Oh my gods. It was Santa Claus all over again, a grand societal conspiracy for the betterment of children. I felt a lot better about being ripped off, since I hadn’t really gotten ripped off, and really, it was dad’s money anyways.\r\n\r\nMy mind went to the obvious conclusion.\r\n\r\n“So Lyra’s going to do something similar? Cool! I’ll have to ask what she did!”\r\n\r\nMom walked in at this point with a bag full of shopping, smiled at us, and went to the kitchen to drop off the food. She popped back out a minute later, and sat down at the table with us.\r\n\r\n“Did dad go over the plan with you?”\r\n\r\n“Just that I was going to be learning skills from him!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but remember – the next two days until you unlock the system, you’re MINE.” She said with a mischievous, gleeful look in her eyes.\r\n\r\nI gulped. Getting skills might not be as fun as I thought. Lyra save meeeeee.\r\n'),

('Nothing But a Hound Dog', 'Beware of Chicken', 4, 'There were many ways Meiling expected her day to go. Watching over the children, collecting herbs, making medicine, tending to whoever got hurt.\r\n\r\nShe was not expecting… this.\r\n\r\nShe was reading a medical scroll when the scent came to her, seemingly carried on the breeze. The boy. He had the stench of qi about him, thicker and headier than she had ever smelled before. He was even more powerful than last time she had laid eyes on him, when he had shared a meal with her father in good spirits, after asking about how they grew their rice.\r\n\r\nWhen the children’s ball struck the tall, broad-shouldered boy pulling a loaded wagon with more ease than an ox, her heart had leapt to her throat. Mud now coated his clothes. All knew that cultivators did not suffer such things. She still remembered many years ago, when she and her father had travelled to the city, and the contemptuous ease with which a cultivator had slain a beggar child for having the gall to get in his way.\r\n\r\nWhen little Xian had rushed to retrieve his ball, she rushed with him, desperate to beg for her little brother’s life.\r\n\r\nInstead, the young man had started laughing.\r\n\r\nHe gave back their ball… and then joined the children in the mud pit.\r\n\r\nNow, the cultivator, for that is only what the young man could be, cackled as he danced through the mud, dodging the children of the village throwing themselves at him in an attempt to knock him into the wallow with grace and skill. He gently diverted them into the muck with wet splats, or picked them up and carried them around the pit, tickling all the while.\r\n\r\nHe had steadily drawn an audience, and more children. At first, the adults too were weary, but now most had wandered off, or sat around the edges and smiled at the silly boy and the kids.\r\n\r\n“Haha! You’re a thousand years too early to defeat me!” He laughed at them, hands on his hips. “My chicken is mightier than all of you!”\r\n\r\nThe children shreiked in outrage, and her dear little brother turned to her.\r\n\r\n“Meimei! Meimei! Help us Big sister Meimei!” he pleaded.\r\n\r\nAnd sealed her doom.\r\n\r\nNot in the traditional sense of a girl being doomed by a cultivator, for she was no beauty, thin and freckly as she was.\r\n\r\nInstead, a massive, gleeful grin spread across the cultivator’s face, and he approached her.\r\n\r\n“Oho?” he asked, leering down at her, “Another challenger?”\r\n\r\n“So what if I am?” She demanded of him, unable to back down under the pleading gazes of the children.\r\n\r\nHe scooped her up, one hand going under her legs, and the other cradling her back. There was no effort to his movement, it was if she weighed nothing at all.\r\n\r\nShe flushed, as she was bought into strong, firm arms… and then the boy unceremoniously jumped into the mud pit with her held securely in his arms.\r\n\r\nIn her clean clothes. After she had just had a bath yesterday.\r\n\r\nShe had no idea what “Ca Wa Bun Ga” meant, but as she felt the mud slop into her clothes, she saw red.\r\n\r\n“You wretched, pig-headed shitmonkey!” she howled, ignoring the fact that she was surrounded by children, and launched herself at the boy who was laughing so hard he had doubled over. Her tackle shoved him over backwards, and into the mud fully. The adults, including her own father, found the entire thing hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe children cheered for their champion, and the boy dashed around the mud pit, and she threw herself after him.\r\n\r\n/////\r\n\r\n“Meiling the hellion!” her father teased her as she prepared dinner. She stuck her nose up in the air contemptuously, and refused to rise to the ribbing.\r\n\r\nThey were to have dinner with that bastard, and she was mightily displeased. Well, most of the village was going to be having dinner with him, but they, as the chiefs of this small village, would have to have that bastard in their home.\r\n\r\nAt least that bastard had provided two deer and several rabbits for them.\r\n\r\nGods, she hated the cultivator and his strong arms and his chiseled jaw….\r\n\r\nGeh! No! She shook her head to clear away the treacherous images her mind provided for her.\r\n\r\nAnd nobody believed her that he was powerful, either. “Sure your nose isn’t off, Meimei?” They had asked, for no cultivator got into a mud fight with children, or went and made friends with peasants.\r\n\r\nEven she was starting to doubt herself, but her ability to smell qi had never steered her wrong before.\r\n\r\nHe would expose his wicked nature soon enough.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the preparation was fortunately uneventful. There were tables set up in the middle of the village, and a great amount of food would be there for everyone to enjoy. They too would be setting out on their visit to Verdant Hill, that they did once every two months.\r\n\r\nMeiling kept a close eye on him, but the cultivator spent most of the time playing go with the men, and losing spectacularly.\r\n\r\nShe had felt uneasy when her best friend, Meihua, had bought them tea. Meihua was everything she wasn’t. She was the classical beauty, with flawless pale skin and full red lips. The few times they went to Verdant Hill, men stopped and stared, struck dumb by her lovliness. She had received marriage proposals from over fifty men, but was determined to marry the clerk Tingfeng.\r\n\r\nSurely, the cultivator would accost her. In all the stories, they were as beasts upon beautiful women!\r\n\r\n“Oh? You’re getting married soon? Congratulations! Wait– here. I don’t know If I can make the wedding, but thats no excuse not to give a gift!”\r\n\r\nInstead, he gave Meihua the most vibrant fox pelt she had ever seen, congratulated her on her upcoming marriage–\r\n\r\nAnd then turned back to the Go table, laughing as he lost again.\r\n\r\n…..maybe her nose was playing tricks on her.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nMan, that Meimei girl was glaring really hard at me, like an offended cat. It was pretty cute, the way her freckly nose scrunched up.\r\n\r\nThe look on her face was hilarious when I dumped her in the mud, though.\r\n\r\nTotally worth it.\r\n\r\n////////\r\n\r\nIt was the dead of night when she woke up, drenched in cold sweat.\r\n\r\nThere was something out there. It stunk of blood and death. Of hate and malice. The terror was nearly overwhelming, sending shakes down her back as the wicked qi invaded the village.\r\n\r\nAnd then, it was suppressed. The cultivator’s qi shoved the bestial qi backwards, repelling the blood and rot with the scent of freshly tilled soil and harvested rice. The fear and dread was repulsed.\r\n\r\nThe cultivator rose from his room, and went to confront the beast.\r\n\r\nMeiling, her legs shaking, followed.\r\n\r\nShe had to know.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nI woke up with an itching feeling crawling down my spine. I could feel some sort of predator nearby, but without Big D to sound the alarm, I hadn’t acted. Groggily, I rolled myself off the futon and stretched.\r\n\r\nEh, might as well take care of it. I grabbed my shovel from my possessions, and wandered out of the house. The fires were still smouldering a little, and I smiled at them. Today had been fun. Childish as hell, but fun. And those dumplings Meimei made were really good.\r\n\r\nThough when I told her that, she scrunched up her nose at me. That girl was too fun to tease.\r\n\r\nI ambled into the forest, following my gut feeling, until I found the wolf.\r\n\r\nOh, man, hes a biggun, isn’t he? Needs his toenails trimmed too.\r\n\r\nIt snarled, and pounced.\r\n\r\n///////////////\r\n\r\nShe followed the cultivator through the winding forest, the scent of blood battling against the smell of earth. She could barely hear, for how hard her heart was pounding, but the cultivator didn’t seem to notice her foot falls.\r\n\r\nAt last they came to the source of the horrific qi, and her blood turned to ice.\r\n\r\nA Reaper Wolf. The Reaper Wolf, The Wicked Blade. It had been around these parts for nearly three hundred years, and had even killed a cultivator!\r\n\r\nWhat was it doing here?! Were they all to die tonight?\r\n\r\nShe cowered behind the tree, and prayed for Jin’s soul, to face such a monster.\r\n\r\nThe Reaper Wolf moved faster than her eyes could see, pouncing on him in a storm of bladed claws.\r\n\r\nThe shovel met it. Klang! It went, striking the fell beast in the center of the head, and slaying it\r\n\r\nShe gaped stupidly at the scene. The cultivator yawned. “Bad Dog.” he muttered, and rubbed at his eye.\r\n\r\nHe took no blood, nor it’s teeth, nor the Wicked Blade’s core. Instead, his shovel went to work, digging a hole big enough for the beast, and burying it in moments.\r\n\r\n“No hard feelings, buddy?” he muttered to the soil, and pressed some of his qi into it. She thought she could hear a wail for a brief moment in her head, and then the lingering scent of blood vanished.\r\n\r\nShe was still standing there in shock when he started walking back to the village. The cultivator squinted at her crouched form.\r\n\r\n“Need a ride back?” he asked her, and her mouth moved before she thought it through..\r\n\r\n“The last time you gave me a ride you threw me into a mud pit.” She said, sounding more annoyed than she felt.\r\n\r\nJin chuffed in amusement, and then gestured forwards.\r\n\r\n“Well come on, dangerous wildlife out here.” he said. “You can make me some dumplings again, as thanks for escorting you home.”\r\n\r\nShe scoffed as if she found the idea distasteful, much to Jin’s amusement, and stood on shaking legs as they left.\r\n\r\nShe turned one last time to look at the overturned dirt.\r\n\r\nThere were grass shoots growing out of it.\r\n\r\nHer father was waiting for them, when they got back to her house, worried about her safety and virtue. “What happened?” he asked. “All of the animals kicked up such a fuss!”\r\n\r\n“Eh, just a wolf.” Jin said sounding unconcerned.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Meiling agreed, “Just a wolf, father.”\r\n\r\nJust a wolf indeed. \r\n'),
('Prologue-Smelting', 'Forge of Destiny', 1, '\r\n\r\nThe carriage was impossibly fast, Ling Qi thought, as she stared out the tiny window at a landscape that was little more than a green and brown blur. She knew she should be excited, maybe awed; she was witnessing the power of Immortals after all. It wasn’t something a girl like her could have ever expected to see.\r\n\r\nInstead, she simply felt numb. Absently, she brushed a strand of unruly black hair out of her eyes. She had let it get too long again, hanging down below her ears as it was. She was being taken to the Wall, the impassable mountains that formed the southern border of the Emerald Seas province. The carriage was bound for the Argent Sect that resided there, and it was all because a terrifying man in a porcelain mask had said that she had the talent to become an Immortal.\r\n\r\nIt was why she sometimes heard voices no one else could hear, why she could feel strange presences when she ventured out to the outskirts of the city where the wards against the spirit beasts were porous and weak. She had always assumed she had been born a bit crazy.\r\n\r\nBoyish, inelegant, crazy Ling Qi, who ran away rather than play doll for her mother.\r\n\r\nIt had grated when she was younger, listening to her mother’s complaints about her appearance and demeanor, hearing the frustration in the woman’s voice when she talked about her. Ling Qi was too tall, too thick of limb, her skin too dark, and her features too long and lacking refinement.\r\n\r\nShe couldn’t say she regretted leaving. It wasn’t as if Mother had tried very hard to find her in the four years since she had run off. Ling Qi blew the stubborn strand of hair out of her eyes again and turned her thoughts away from the past. It was pointless now; she would never grow up to be like her Mother, and so, she had left. She was free, even if it meant facing hunger and cold. Even if it meant she had often been hurt or frightened. She might be ugly, be poor, but she was herself, did as she wanted, which to her was all that mattered. It had to be.\r\n\r\nWhich was why this grated on her.\r\n\r\nShe should have been ecstatic, the only commoner from her city that had the talent... Would any other denizen of Tonghou be able to raise their heads in front of her by the time she was done training? Would even Mother be able to criticize her? No, of course not.\r\n\r\nShe still wasn’t happy though, because once again she found herself without a choice. She had no money, no resources. Even if she had gone back to Mother, the woman wouldn’t have been able to pay the fees described by the recruiter, and if she had refused to go along to the sect, her talent would be removed. She hated the idea of something that was hers being taken away even more.\r\n\r\nSo once she was done training, she would owe the Empire eight years of military service instead. Not very long at all in an Immortal’s lifespan, she had been assured. Really she couldn’t say that the idea of facing off against the wind riding mountain barbarians like a figure out of a story didn’t excite her.\r\n\r\nShe just hated not having a choice.\r\n\r\nLing Qi shook her head and turned away from the blurring landscape outside the carriage window. The carriage was eerily quiet. More magic, she supposed, and despite her misgivings, she couldn’t help the spark of excitement she felt at the thought.\r\n\r\nStill, it had been hours since they left, and she was bored. Even at this speed, it would still be some time until she arrived. So rather than continuing to mope about the past, she decided to turn her attention to the leather satchel sitting on the bench across from her. It contained her meager possessions: a few coins, some clothing, and an old wooden flute that she had liked to play on occasion. Mother’s music lessons had been one of her happier memories.\r\n\r\nIt also contained what she had been provided by the recruiter. Reaching over, Ling Qi picked up the bag and flipped it open. Peering inside, she ran her fingers over the bundle of grey cloth that sat on top. She once again marveled at the smooth softness of the material. Her disciple’s uniform, the man had said. Something provided to less well off disciples, since normal clothing would have difficulty holding up to the rigors of training.\r\n\r\nThere were a few other things too: a hand mirror, a comb, and a sewing kit, among a few other miscellaneous items. She supposed the implication was that she should make herself presentable before she arrived. She glanced down at her rather ragged brown shirt, pants, and muddy sandals. Not exactly the most impressive outfit.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time in a long time that it might matter though. She hadn’t had much time before she had been shuffled into the carriage. If she was going to make an effort, she should do it now. Ling Qi glanced toward the locked door on the other side of the carriage, then back toward the window. There was enough space at least; it really seemed like the carriage was meant for several people. After another moment contemplating the contents of the satchel, she drew the shutter down over the window and got to work changing.\r\n\r\nSome time later, Ling Qi sat back down with a frown on her face, idly smoothing the wrinkles out of the amazingly soft gray fabric of the outfit she now wore. It was… nice, but she hadn’t worn a dress in years. At least it didn’t pinch and cling like the ones Mother used to try and make her wear.\r\n\r\nIt was layered and cut on the bottom half to allow for easy movement, but annoyingly loose around her hips. She had had to bunch up the sash and tie it twice. At least the wide, billowy sleeves would be good for concealing her hands. She could also hide things inside them pretty easily with a bit of work. The embroidery of clouds and stylized wind currents were kind of nice too.\r\n\r\nShe still felt uncomfortable though. It felt strange to wear something that probably cost more than a month of a laborer’s wages. Well, maybe whatever this was made of was the Immortal equivalent of sack cloth? She glanced down at the mirror in her hands. There weren’t any cosmetics provided thankfully, so apparently they didn’t expect her to dress up that much.\r\n\r\nThere had been a few hairpins though, made of some kind of painted bone. She thought they went well with her bright blue eyes. That was her best feature in her own opinion. No one else in her hometown had eyes that shade. Not that her effort at pinning up her hair in some resemblance of order had prevented the strands from falling back into her eyes. Maybe she could learn some kind of magic to manage that, she thought idly.\r\n\r\nAs she put the mirror away and reached for the clean sandals that had been under the uniform, the carriage suddenly jerked, almost sending her tumbling headfirst into her bag. Snapping a hand up to grab the frame of the window, she managed to steady herself.\r\n\r\n“Be ready. We’re nearly at the entrance plaza,” sounded the voice of the man who was driving the carriage. He had seemed… less formal than she would imagine an Immortal to be, greeting her kindly as she had passed the two adults to enter the carriage.\r\n\r\nCuriously, she lifted the shutter that she had pulled down over the window. They were now moving along at a much more normal pace while traveling up a meandering mountain path. Somehow, the inside of the carriage remained level despite the slope.\r\n\r\n“I will be ready shortly,” Ling Qi called back after a moment’s hesitation. Whatever had been blocking the sounds from outside was gone, she noticed with a start. She could hear birdsong and the sound of the horse’s hooves again as well.\r\n\r\n“H-how long do I have?” she asked tentatively a moment later, frowning at the hesitant stutter that had come out despite her best efforts. She was nervous, but she couldn’t let them see that. One thing she had learned quite well by now was that the appearance of confidence was important.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’ve got a few more minutes more,” the man called back in a lackadaisical tone. “The Sect doesn’t like us speeding on the mountain, at least for those of us stuck on the ground anyway.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi blinked. Was he implying that some would be arriving by flight? She had heard stories… but had thought that mostly the domain of the mountain barbarians.\r\n\r\n“Thank you. I’ll just be a moment.” It felt strange to revert to the speech Mother had taught rather than the more relaxed kind she had gotten used to in the last few years, but it felt like a good idea. If there was one thing Mother had been right about, it was that first impressions mattered.\r\n\r\nShaking off such thoughts for the moment, she reached down for the sandals, a determined expression on her face. She would need to be ready.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage finally came to a stop, Ling Qi felt she was as prepared as she could be, given that she didn’t precisely know what was coming next. The driver hadn’t said anything else, and neither had she, preoccupied as she had been with trying to focus and keeping the nervous thoughts that kept flitting through her head from showing.\r\n\r\nThere was a thud from outside and the sound of footsteps walking around the carriage as she stood, self-consciously smoothing the wrinkles in her new uniform. Shortly thereafter, there was another click and the door opened, revealing the driver.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to read his face, or anything really, given how well covered he was. He wore a strange, wide brimmed hat from which hung paper slips covered in odd symbols. It left his eyes barely visible in the gaps between the slips. The high collar of his deep blue robe rose to meet the hangings, concealing the rest of his face. Somehow, he managed to give the impression that he was smiling.\r\n\r\n“Need a hand getting down?” he asked pleasantly offering a gloved hand to her.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be fine, thank you,” Ling Qi responded with confidence she didn’t quite feel, hesitating only a moment before picking up the now lightened satchel and stepping down slowly to avoid tripping on the hem of her dress.\r\n\r\nAs she reached the bottom of the steps, she finally got a look at her surroundings. The two of them stood on a wide stone plaza built upon a plateau carved into the mountainside. She could see the steep road they had traveled to get here wind past the ornate gate that broke the stone fence encircling the plaza and vanishing into the mist below.\r\n\r\nThere was only a single building here, a large two story structure with a high peaked roof that reminded her both of a temple and the scholars’ testing hall in Tonghou City. The plaza was dotted with small, tastefully arranged gardens centered around tall peach trees. There was still a trickle of people going into the building dressed in similar uniforms, as well as several other similar carriages, each with their own eclectically dressed driver.\r\n\r\n“Hey, might not want to stand around staring too long.” She startled as the driver’s amused voice jolted her from her thoughts. Ling Qi glanced over at him and then back to the central building. He was facing away from her, working to free the odd, blue furred horses from their harness.\r\n\r\n“You’re in the last group of arrivals so one of the elders will be down soon to lay out the rules. You’re assigned to hall one by the way.” He patted one of the horses on the neck, drawing a snort from the beast, as he turned back to face her.\r\n\r\nLing Qi still hadn’t gotten a proper look at his face, but somehow, the tilt of his head gave the impression that he was examining her, making her straighten her posture unconsciously.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she responded after a moment. “And… where is hall one? And is there anything else I should know?”\r\n\r\n“In the front door. Just follow the signs,” he responded dismissively, crossing his arms. The act tugged the long sleeves of his robe up, showing that his gloves extended to at least his elbows. He paused, once again giving her the feeling of being appraised.\r\n\r\n“The Elders will lay out the rules. Just be respectful,” he added in a lazy tone. “But… find some friends and be quick about it. Loners tend to have trouble. You can’t watch your back all the time, you know?” His monstrosity of a hat tilted to the side, and she got the impression that he was smiling again. “Call it advice from a senior who was in a similar spot.”\r\n\r\nShe… had never been particularly good at making friends, much less keeping them, but she could take friendly advice with good grace.\r\n\r\n“Thank you again. I should be on my way though.” Her voice was more hesitant than she would have liked. She turned to head toward the building then stopped.\r\n\r\n“Might I know your name?” she asked. It seemed silly to not at least introduce herself to someone who seemed helpful.\r\n\r\n“Dong Fu,” he responded easily. “You’re right. Get going. You don’t want to be late, and I already know your name.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi dipped her head in his direction and set off, hurrying along as fast as she could manage in her new clothes.\r\n\r\nThe Sect’s central building loomed ahead. Somehow, she knew, things would never be quite the same again once she crossed that threshold.\r\n\r\n'),
('Rebirth', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 1, '\r\n\r\nA raw, primal scream was being wrenched from my throat, my mind and body wracked by pain. The pain of loss, the pain of death, the pain of ending.\r\n\r\nA crisp snap broke through my screaming, the pair of fingers that did the deed appearing in my vision. An old pair of fingers started the snap; a young pair of fingers ended the snap. I felt a strange force invade my mind, grab something, twist, and rip. I cried out in pain, a sense of loss washing over me. My mouth closed, every breath sending fresh flames of torment radiating from my lungs.\r\n\r\nA tall, thin man was in front of me, speaking. “I do really hate the screaming, but I suppose that’s what happens when you mortals die.”\r\n\r\nWait what!? Die!? I was in class just a second ago! What did he mean die!? I was too young to die! I could feel the panic quickly mounting again, my breath becoming shorter and faster as I started to hyperventilate.\r\n\r\n“Who are you? Where is this? What do you mean die!?”\r\n\r\nAs I shot my questions off rapid-fire, I looked around.\r\n\r\nI was disoriented. Dazed. Pain and anguish were clawing at my heart, my mind, my very soul, but slowly, oh so slowly, it was starting to fade.\r\n\r\nUntil I noticed where I was. And where I wasn’t.\r\n\r\nThen it all came rushing back, and while I’d been silenced nothing stopped me from hyperventilating there’snoairhereohmygod!\r\n\r\nA pair of fingers snapped again, and the man spoke once more, derision dripping from the single word he uttered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Honestly.”\r\n\r\nMy mind cleared.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI wasn’t sure where I was anymore – I seemed to be floating in space, surrounded by twinkling stars and galaxies, comets and planets. It wasn’t home, it wasn’t school, it wasn’t even earth. There was nobody present except the tall thin man, floating impossibly in front of me, looking both ancient and young, happy and sad, male and female, tall and short, fat and skinny, red and blue – wait what?\r\n\r\nI pinched myself, putting all my might into it. Only thing to do really. This dream was way too trippy for me.\r\n\r\nI jumped as an electric shock went through me. I was still here, wherever here was. That didn’t bode well.\r\n\r\nI might be in a minor spot of serious trouble.\r\n\r\nA deep, long-suffering sigh escaped him? Her?\r\n\r\n“You died. I took the memory of you dying to calm you down. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to have worked nearly as well as it should’ve.”, and I heard, barely under her breath “Mortals.”\r\n\r\nI felt an enforced calmness come over me, my panic not going away, just… not mattering anymore. Given where I was, strange floating among the stars with what can only be described as a super powerful shape-shifter, I could believe I had died. This wasn’t Kansas anymore.\r\n\r\n“Now then, we can have a discussion. You have died. Your soul has failed to properly re-enter the cycle of reincarnation, and I found you just floating in the void.”\r\n\r\nTheir face twisted in an unhappy grimace, and I felt an instinctive fear run through my…\r\n\r\nDid I even have a body anymore? Was I just a soul now?\r\n\r\nI didn\'t know what to make of being told I’d died, that my life was over. I did know that I hadn’t been old, or even middle-aged when I died. Had I even made it to adulthood!? I tried to make a disgruntled noise – the enforced calm was preventing any sort of outrage, only to discover that I couldn’t make a sound.\r\n\r\nThat bastard.\r\n\r\nWe couldn’t have a ‘discussion’ if I couldn’t say a single word! I guess he just wanted to monologue, and my input could take a jolly hike.\r\n\r\n“I’m Papilion, the God of Change,” she grandly announced, to an audience of one – and that constant shifting of male to female, young to old, pleased to outraged made a bit more sense, although it was giving me a pounding headache to follow. “And you’re being reincarnated. Normally, as souls are reincarnated through the cycle of life and death, all of their memories are erased. They’re given a clean slate to start over. I don’t know what to make of you, a lone soul lost to Samsara, so you have the option of keeping some of your memories. Regrettably, a newborn’s mind is simply too small for all of the things you know, and you do know quite a few dangerous things. What is your choice? Would you like to start as a blank slate, a new life? Or keep some of your knowledge, some of who you are, knowing that you’ll never be able to go back, be forever incomplete, missing a part of yourself?”\r\n\r\nI wasn’t ready to make a decision of this scale. Hell, 10 minutes ago by my reckoning, I was debating what to eat for lunch, deciding if I wanted to buy that dress or not, and figuring out how to get all my homework done!\r\n\r\nPoof! Like a magician’s disappearing act, it was all gone! A mote of dust in the breeze, smoke wrapped in the wind, the last ember soaked in water.\r\n\r\nMy entire life was over. Everything I’d worked for and accomplished gone in a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nThe crushing weight of that threatened to overwhelm me, but then the absurdity hit.\r\n\r\nI was dead. It wasn’t like I could make any worse choices now, could I?\r\n\r\nWhat was the worst that could happen now?\r\n\r\nOn one hand, I could keep my memories. Sounded painful, more emotional than physical. I would lose everyone I had ever known – my parents, my best friend, my brother, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends – everyone. I would know it. I would be aware. It was like a plague went through and I had to attend a hundred funerals at once, but the only funeral anyone would be attending was mine. The option to just… forget… was tempting, especially if it was as thorough as removing the memory of me dying was.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it sounded like this was a rare chance. Not everyone got to keep their memories – even if it was only a fraction of them – and start over again, tabula rasa. It was tempting, just for the aspect of doing something nobody – wait, maybe this had happened before – had done.\r\n\r\n“Can… can I ask some questions….?” I asked, getting a single arched eyebrow back as a response. That might be a “go ahead”, but it might also be a “you dare question me mortal”, and I wasn’t going to play games with my life. Err… afterlife? Soul? Reincarnation?\r\n\r\nI decided not to ask any questions, and mull it over myself. There wasn’t much more to add.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I felt that the choice was forced. As some famous philosopher said “You die twice. Once when you die, and once when someone speaks your name for the last time.” I might have died and lost my first body, but my soul and memories were intact. That was alive enough for me, and I fully intended to keep it that way. I was too young to die.\r\n\r\n“I would like to keep my memories.” I said with far more confidence than I felt. The god in front of me smiled as he started to morph into a strange bird – it looked like a crow, but it had too many feet. Somehow, his voice was all the same coming out of a beak.\r\n\r\n“Right then. Chemistry, gone. Physics, gone. Far too dangerous to know that where you’re going. Scientific method – you can do too much damage with that. Broad strokes of history – fine, but the details are completely superfluous, and we need to make room. Mathematics – keep the basics, but calculus will do nothing for you where you’re headed. Arts, literature – useless, but removing it will change you too much. There’s not much point in letting you keep your memories if you’re a completely different person. Interpersonal relationships – they can stay, same reason. English – I suppose you need a starting baseline. French? Spanish? Entirely useless. Gone. Hmm… a few more things to clean up… and we’re done! Prepare to be reincarnated as a Golden Crow.”\r\n\r\nI felt the strange force from before entering my mind, magnitudes more powerful and painful than before, rooting around in my head. Each time the crow squawked, I felt something rip out from my mind, and I tried to hold back tears of pain. By the time math was gone – I never liked it, but was indescribably sad at it leaving – I was curled up on the floor weeping silently. Not that there was a floor, just more floating in space. But when he said ‘Prepare to be reincarnated as a Golden Crow” I shot up, panic racing through me, somehow about to speak again.\r\n\r\n“NO! I WANT TO BE HUMAN! MAKE ME HUMAN! HUMA-“\r\n\r\nA pair of fingers snapped.\r\n\r\nI was floating in warm, wet darkness. I had been floating here for quite some time, and I was doing lots of thinking. My first instinct was that it was all a bad dream, but I had fallen asleep and woken up too often for that to be the case. So, it seemed like I had truly died, and was being reincarnated.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I was unsure about was if I was going to be human, a ‘Golden Crow’, whatever that was, or something else entirely. This whole reincarnation thing really needed a user manual or something. I didn’t seem to have a shell, but there was no telling really.\r\n\r\nAt least, I was pretty sure something called a crow would be hatched from an egg. Who knew what I actually knew and what got ripped out by that cruel, capricious god. Who knew what was real, and what I just made up on my own as I floated here in the dark, trying desperately to plug the holes in my memories, holes where I knew things should be but were not.\r\n\r\nI wanted to go home. I wanted to see mom again. I wanted dad to hug me, to tell me everything was going to be ok. Maybe I could look them up on the internet when I was old enough, tell them that I was ok. Would they even believe me? Would they think it’s just some cruel hoax?\r\n\r\nI could probably tell them enough about me, enough about them, growing up. How the sun hit the windows, how it would go through the crude ‘stained glass’ plastic I made in 4th grade. That Becky was my best friend until 2nd grade, when she moved. How our dog Aoife used to eat anything and everything – proven by the Great Banana Peel Experiment – and was taken too soon. What was an ‘experiment’ anyways?\r\n\r\nThe fact that some knowledge was considered “too dangerous” for where I was going implied that I wasn’t heading back to the time I came from. I thinly tried to hold on hope that Papilion had meant “too dangerous to be born knowing so much”, but I knew I was just deluding myself. I grieved. I lamented. I cursed fate, cursed the gods. It changed nothing. They were most likely all lost to me.\r\n\r\nWaking period by waking period, the details of my past life got dulled, along with the pain of losing everyone I knew. Random things stayed – like why did I still know my bus schedule? How did that stay, why didn’t it get stripped out? Others faded. I could only name half of the people in my biology class, I had no idea who my teachers were last year, and the details of the latest book I had been reading were gone.\r\n\r\nGod, I wanted to read again. To pick up a book, sit in a cozy chair by the fire, and just lose myself in the pages. Rarely was I so happy as when I was reading. Although, “God” might be a bit of a strange epithet, after now knowing there were gods, and it didn’t seem like there was just one. Otherwise he (she? Them? What pronoun did a shape-shifting god (goddess??) use anyways? – I decided to use he, since that was the first and the last form shown to save my sanity until said god of change told me otherwise.) probably wouldn’t have referred to himself as “the god of change”, and probably just “god”. God. This was tricky.\r\n\r\nI had entirely too much time to think, and nothing else to do. I tried flailing about now and then, just for a change of pace, but I rapidly hit soft walls all around me that absorbed what I did and gave. I tried to brace myself and push out, but had no luck. I would rapidly tire out and fall asleep after each attempt.\r\n\r\nI kept at it though, because there was nothing else to do. Except think. And there was nobody to bounce my thoughts off of, nobody to interact with, and just far too much time on my hands (claws? Please not claws.) God. Gods.\r\n\r\nI occasionally heard noises, as if coming off from a great distance underwater, but couldn’t make anything out. I would redouble my escape efforts whenever I heard that – maybe someone could let me out? But it never made a difference. The noises were usually soothing, which was nice, but being unable to really make anything out, it wasn’t that much of a change. At least it broke up the monotony. Inevitably after each attempt, I would get exhausted and fall asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen would this end?\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs couldn’t last, and one day I felt the fleshy walls of my prison contract around me, squeezing me. I felt a sharp spike of fear go through me, and I flailed more in panic. There wasn’t anything else I could do. This did seem to strongly imply that I didn’t need to escape with a beak, which gave me a brief sense of relief – only for panic to set in once again as the walls contracted around me, squeezing all over. Again, and again, pain and pause, the relief between each movement constantly shortened. I was battered, I felt bruised all over, but finally, with one last massive squeeze, I emerged into the world, and a massive deluge of information.\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Welcome to Pallos!]\r\n\r\n[Name: Elaine]\r\n\r\n[Race: Human]\r\n\r\n[Age: 0]\r\n\r\n[Time remaining on System locks: 68,820:43:16]\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Due to the great efforts of [Hero] Herculix, you get a +1 bonus to all stats!

But more than that –\r\n\r\nGiants. Giants all around me. Some yelling, some screaming, two covered in blood. The noise grated, and went right between my ears, nails on chalkboard. I was picked up, incomprehensible language babbled all around me, and looking down, I saw a female giant bleeding profusely. Another giantess elbowed her way in, put her hand on the first giant, yelled something, and I watched the flesh of the first giant knit itself back together!\r\n\r\nHoly shitballs there was magic here!\r\n\r\nI looked up for the first time, and realized that we were in a field under the open sky. I was passed down to the giantess who was healed, my head being moved around as I saw more of the night sky, and I saw them.\r\n\r\nTwo crimson cat’s eyes with slitted pupils glared down from the sky to me, watching me, seeing every movement I made. I could feel the weight of its ominous gaze pressing on me, suffocating. The strange floating words, being manhandled by giants, the screaming, getting battered and bruised, the blood, the magic - it was too much. I screamed and cried and flailed about, and didn’t stop until my voice gave out and I passed out from exhaustion.\r\n\r\n'),
('Rice Farming 101', 'Beware of Chicken', 2, 'I jolted awake to Big D’s furious battle cry, and the angry sqwalling of a fox. I had a shovel in my hand and was out the door as fast as I could into the extremely pleasant night.\r\n\r\nBig D was flapping around the fox’s head, kicking at it furiously. He was too young for his spurs to deal any damage, but he was trying his little heart out.\r\n\r\nI was transfixed for a moment, as David challenged Goliath.\r\n\r\nUntil the fox managed to hit him with it’s paw, and knocked him down and away. His footing was fouled. His fate was sealed. The Fox pounced, It’s razor sharp teeth going for the kill, to end my little warrior.\r\n\r\nOh? You dare trespass into this Daddy’s domain?!\r\n\r\n….I can’t believe I just thought that. I snort to myself.\r\n\r\nThe fox’s teeth clamped down on iron instead of flesh, and it looked up, shocked at the intervention.\r\n\r\nIt was then the fox realised it fucked up.\r\n\r\nMy shovel whirled, and with a klang! The fox died.\r\n\r\nI looked to my little warrior. He had managed to get to his feet, and was glaring as hatefully as he could at the fox’s corpse. I gave him a once over, and he was fine, as were my girls. Just a fright.\r\n\r\nI didn’t blame the fox, it was his nature. I hoped he didn’t blame me for braining him with a shovel in retaliation.\r\n\r\nAnd then selling his fur, because I’m totally going to do that. And I think you can eat fox.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nYou can, in fact eat fox. wouldn’t recommend it. Tastes like ass.\r\n\r\n//////////\r\n\r\nGrowing rice properly involves a bit more than just chucking your seed into the ground and hoping for the best. I had witnessed the cultivation method of the farmers from the village, and they were a bit… lacking.\r\n\r\nFor example, the first thing you do is soak it in a 1/16 ratio of salted water. The rice seed with the greatest amount of endosperm, and therefore the best chance of a yield will sink to the bottom of your barrel, while the rest will float to the top.\r\n\r\nThen, after soaking, you plant the desirable seeds in wide buckets for the first part of their life as they sprout.\r\n\r\nThen, finally, you transplant them to your paddies. I always found it rather strange that rice does better when you rip it out of the soil and stuff it somewhere else than leaving it be.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that I learned most of this from reading a manga. Thanks, Shizuko. Cheating using techniques from the 1860s when I was in a mid-to pre-thousands world, like all true Isekai heroes!\r\n\r\nExcept guns would be pretty much useless, and I had no desire to conquer the world. Eh, rice is more important than that stuff anyways.\r\n\r\nBut enough about that. I was currently on the “sprouting” stage. The paddies themselves were under way, carved into the side of one of the hills in the terraced style, and fed by one of the small rivers, for when it finally came time to flood them.\r\n\r\nCultivator strength and endurance always did turn tasks that should have taken months or years into matters of mere days.\r\n\r\nThough sometimes I had a sneaking suspicion that my “zen” modes lasted for longer than I thought they did. I was always super hungry when they stopped, and occasionally Big D was giving me the gimlet eye when I got back home.\r\n\r\nCultivation be whack, yo.\r\n\r\nI grunted, as I finished examining the terrace wall for any potential defects. It looked pretty good, but just in case, I pushed some more of my qi into it, lending my spirit to help reinforce the wall, and strengthen the grass’ roots to keep everything steady.\r\n\r\nThe masters at the sects would probably have an aneurysm about how much qi I was “wasting”, but I didn’t see it as a waste. It was a resource. If you got it, use it. Besides, it didn’t take that long for it to come back. At the start of the next day I was normally feeling fresh as a daisy. Maybe if I was a better cultivator, or had bigger reserves, it might take longer, but I didn’t know, and didn’t care.\r\n\r\nYawning, I wandered back to my little house, Big D greeting me with his signature screech.\r\n\r\n“You tell em, Big D.” I scratched his head affectionately. His defeat hadn’t made him nervous, so that was good. He was still a little ball of piss and vinegar.\r\n\r\nMy Lowly Spiritual Herbs were growing in their buckets beside my sprouting rice. The spirit herbs needed qi to grow properly, and I figured, why not just juice the rice too? Can’t be any harm.\r\n\r\nI had also repotted the strange root I had found. I couldn’t just run off to the archive, so this was the only way I had to store it, and It had some qi to it. So It got a dousing too.\r\n\r\nI carefully infused my spirit into the water, and then picked up my watering can and got to work, with Big D sitting on my shoulder, occasionally hopping off to snap up a bug that dared try to assault my little grow operation.\r\n\r\nGood Boy. More spirit greens for you after dinner.\r\n\r\n/////\r\n\r\nAnd so things went. I had to brain a few more foxes and a starving looking wolf, but otherwise, things were largely peaceful.\r\n\r\nChop wood.\r\n\r\nBreak rock.\r\n\r\nPlant crop.\r\n\r\nNurture with qi.\r\n\r\nEat food.\r\n\r\nSleep.\r\n\r\nMonths pass.\r\n\r\nI love it here.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nThe Great Master had given him the name Bi De. He knew not what it meant, but he knew the name was his. He knew it was powerful.\r\n\r\nBut he was not.\r\n\r\nAwareness was a fickle thing. It came and it went. But he knew during those times. He thought. And he was elevated above those who were beneath him. During the night, his senses were sharper, to better alert the Great Master to interlopers, those of red fur and sharp teeth.\r\n\r\nBut every time he failed in something he knew was his duty, to defend the females, he knew great shame. His Great Master nurtured him without reservation anyways, treating him like a favoured son, and not the shameful thing he was.\r\n\r\nHe was weak. He had to grow in strength, and fulfill his destiny!\r\n\r\nHe rode upon the Great Master’s shoulder while he infused their food with his very essence, and struck from above upon the base creatures that dared to sup off his powerful essence.\r\n\r\nHe stood the night watch while the Great Master slept. He guarded the home while the Great Master completed his great wonders, commanding the land and taming the forest.\r\n\r\nHe watched, as the Great Master moved in the morning, his body flowing with wondrous skill.\r\n\r\nAnd so he sought to improve himself. He ran through the Great Master’s Lands. He jumped over the hills, and onto the giant branches of trees. He shoved his body against the Great Pots of Growth, until he could finally move them.\r\n\r\nAnd now, he stood upon the Great Pillars of The Fa Ram (another name with a surely sublime meaning), and gave it his all to imitate the Great Master, to have some pale imitation of his sublime skill.\r\n\r\nHis body soared through the air. His legs lashed out with strength unknown to his lesser kin. He danced as the Great Master danced. He did breath, as the Great Master drew breath.\r\n\r\nSomething swirled around him.\r\n\r\nWithin him.\r\n\r\n/////////\r\n\r\nI smiled at Big D as he hopped and kicked along my fence.\r\n\r\nCute little guy. \r\n');

('Smelting 2', 'Forge of Destiny', 2, 'As it turned out, Dong Fu was correct. The signs were quite clear. Only a handful of other silver robed youths remained in the wide open entrance hall as she entered, and none of them paid her any more than a passing glance.\r\n\r\nThe rear wall of the entrance hall was taken up by a massive board of ebony wood. A banner was strung up on the board, clearly delineating directions for new disciples. The spotlessly clean wooden interior of the building was honestly a little unsettling. It was unnatural; the floor was so polished that it was practically a mirror, and she couldn’t see a single scuff or mark anywhere, let alone a speck of dust.\r\n\r\nShe couldn’t give that too much thought, however, because she was one of the last ones in. As she arrived at the sliding doors marking the entrance to hall one, she could hear the murmur of a large number of people speaking quietly within.\r\n\r\nPeering inside, she could see that the large room was built with a series of long desks placed on descending tiers, broken up by shallow steps going down to the pit where the lecturer’s podium stood. The desks were almost completely full, and as she stepped inside, Ling Qi caught more than one curious, dismissive, or assessing look from the crowd of chattering fourteen year olds already present. It made her hackles rise; the feeling of condescending dismissal was an almost physical thing.\r\n\r\nGiving herself a shake, she forced herself to ignore it and search for empty seats.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious and first to draw her eye was a whole section which lay empty centered on a pale girl. The girl had snow white hair that fell freely down to the middle of her back and was everything Ling Qi was not: petite and dainty with almost supernaturally pale skin. She was whispering into the sleeve of her uniform, which had been personalized with a scale-like pattern in the embroidery. She seemed to be paying very little attention to her surroundings, yet she sat alone in an otherwise packed room.\r\n\r\nThe girl raised her head then, looking toward Ling Qi. Ling Qi felt her blood run cold for as she saw the other girl’s eyes, golden and slit pupiled. A shudder of animalistic fear rippled up her spine. The moment ended when the other girl broke eye contact and returned her attention to a bright green snake which had just poked its head out of her sleeve.\r\n\r\nWhat was that? She had felt like a mouse in front of a serpent, yet the girl’s expression hadn’t even been hostile nor condescending, just indifferent.\r\n\r\nLing Qi quickly turned her attention to the other possible seats. There was another girl who had a seat open next to her. She was leanly muscled with sun-darkened skin and bright red hair woven into a single braid. The splash of color stood out amidst the rest of the room.\r\n\r\nStrangely, she was wearing a partial boys uniform: a pair of baggy pants rather than a robe and a silken sleeveless shirt. Ling Qi might have thought her a feminine boy if not for how… stretched the shirt she wore was. Unlike the others, who were seated with meticulous posture, she sat with her feet propped on the desk in front of her and a bored expression on her face. Her gaze briefly flickered Ling Qi\'s way before the laid back girl seemed to dismiss her as unimportant.\r\n\r\nFurther down, there was an open seat adjacent to the steps next to a tall boy, tall enough that she wouldn’t be looking down at him if they stood face to face. He was… well, a little handsome Ling Qi could admit, in the classical way, with noble features and good proportions. But not girlish, the way some nobles and wealthy sorts could get.\r\n\r\nMainly, her attention was drawn by the gold furred tiger cub curled up on top of his head. She stared for a moment, but no one else seemed to think it odd. When he noticed her look, the boy gave her a friendly smile and a slight nod that made the cub on his head growl unhappily.\r\n\r\nThe last available seat was in the room’s far corner next to a short young man with with shaggy brown hair and a rather nasty burn scar extending across his right cheek, down his neck, and under his shirt. It was quite ugly, and it took a moment to pull her eyes from the scar to look at the rest of him. He was of middling height and compact build. Just from a glance, she would guess him to be one of the few others in this room to be of the same… social class as her. He certainly looked as out of place and uncomfortable as she felt.\r\n\r\nWhen he met her eyes, his gaze was measuring and wary. Her eyes skittered away immediately. He reminded her too much of Tonghou, and wasn’t she going to leave that behind?\r\n\r\nLing Qi glanced between the open seats, but in the end, the choice was obvious. Dong Fu’s advice still echoed in her ears, and… if she was honest with herself, she wanted to follow it.\r\n\r\nIt came down to loneliness in the end. If there was one thing Ling Qi’s effort to remain unconstrained had failed to give her, it was friends. Given Mother’s occupation, that pool had always been limited to begin with and living as she had for the last four years had not allowed her to spend a long time in anyone’s company.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, she chose the option that at least seemed friendly. She began to make her way down the stairs toward the handsome boy with the tiger cub at a sedate pace. Even if his friendliness was a facade, it was better than indifference or hostility.\r\n\r\nThat seemed to trigger most of those who had been looking at her askance to go back to their own conversations. Now that she had the opportunity to study them, Ling Qi could see that there seemed to be several cliques among those seated here. She was no socialialite, but she could see that there was no room for someone like her there.\r\n\r\nAs she came to a stop next to the desk where the boy was seated, she did her best to put her doubts and worries aside, but it was a difficult thing.\r\n\r\n“D’you mind if I sit here?” The words escaped her before she could really think about it, and she clenched her fists under her sleeves. She had been trying to remember to speak formally, but it wasn’t something that came naturally to her anymore. Now he was going to think she was…\r\n\r\n“Sure thing.” His laid back words cut off her internal panic. The boy shifted in his seat, moving over a bit to give her more room. The easy smile he gave her absolutely did not make her heartbeat speed up.\r\n\r\n“You were kinda cutting it close though, weren’t you?” He had a slight accent that she couldn’t place, which combined with his laid back attitude, seemed to draw his words out oddly.\r\n\r\nLing Qi hastily seated herself before too much attention could be drawn to her embarrassed flush. Not that most were likely to care, her more reasonable side would point out. She glanced up to find him regarding her with something like amusement.\r\n\r\nThe tiger cub curled up atop his head seemed to be sleeping again, and she briefly wondered how it hadn’t fallen when he’d turned his head to look at her.\r\n\r\n“My carriage only just arrived,” she responded, more defensively than she would have liked. She suddenly remembered that she hadn’t introduced herself yet.\r\n\r\n“I am Ling Qi by the way,” she said quickly. “If.. ah, you were wondering, I…” She hated the way her voice trailed off into awkward uncertainty. Let her slip through a busy street dipping her hands into pockets or stand up to a fence trying to swindle her, and she could be confident. Apparently, friendly conversation could make her composure crumble in moments.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, her damn hair was working its way loose again. She already had a few unruly strands drifting in front of her eyes.\r\n\r\nFor his part, the boy gave her an odd look out of the corner of his eye as she hunched her shoulders, feeling stupid.\r\n\r\n“Han Jian,” he said after a moment. “Nice to meet you. Can’t say I recognize the name. If your carriage just got here, you must be local so that makes sense. My tutors always complained about me not paying enough attention.” He says the last with a self-deprecating smile.\r\n\r\nHis easy acceptance eased the tension Ling Qi felt and allowed her to sit up straighter. Doing so made her notice that aside from Han Jian, she just might be the tallest person in the room. So much for standing out less.\r\n\r\nStill, the implied question made her feel awkward. Was he only being polite because he thought she might be someone of noble birth like him? He seemed almost too casual to be a noble though.\r\n\r\n“My family isn’t very important,” she decided to hedge. “Where are you from? I’m, I mean, I am not familiar with yours either.” She stumbled over the words more than she would have liked, but she felt that it was still a decent deflection.\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and Ling Qi felt the corners of her lips quirk up. It was hard to stay tense around him.\r\n\r\n“Guess we’re both a couple of slackers then,” he responded, sounding amused. “The Han family is from the Golden Fields province.” He seemed really amused but also… almost relieved?\r\n\r\nGolden Fields… the name was vaguely familiar as if she had heard it once a long time ago. It came to her then. Golden Fields was the easternmost province of the empire, and more importantly...\r\n\r\n“Oh, the Grave of the Sun. I didn’t think someone would come from so far away.” She trailed off as she noticed that his smile had gone rather stiff.\r\n\r\nDid she say something rude? The story of Lu Guanxi and his final stand was famous. He was one of the Empire’s greatest heroes. She couldn’t really think of a reason why mentioning the hero would offend him. Maybe his family had sent him away and he didn’t like being reminded of how far away he was?\r\n\r\nHe gave a slightly forced laugh. “Yeah, that’s the one. I guess most people only remember us for that old story these days.”\r\n\r\nLing Qi looked away awkwardly, pursing her lips. What had she said? She cast around for a change of subject to hopefully end the uncomfortable silence. Eventually, her eyes settled back on his pet, which she noticed had now opened its eyes and was staring down at her with the sort of imperious disdain that only a feline could manage.\r\n\r\n“So… where did you get your pet? I’ve never seen one like that.” Truly, she was a master of conversation and that wasn’t stilted at all.\r\n\r\nWhy did it feel like the little tiger cub was glaring at her now?\r\n\r\nHe blinked, but accepted the subject change. “I was introduced to Heijin by my Grandmother a few years back when I managed to awaken my qi. He’s not really a pet though, more like a little cousin.”\r\n\r\nWhat was that supposed to mean? Ling Qi had heard of some people treating their animals like family, so maybe he was just one of those. She was about to ask for clarification when a muffled boom cut through the buzz of conversation in the room.\r\n\r\nLike the others in the room, her attention was drawn to the source of the sound. It came from below where a tall, thin man had appeared at the lecturer’s podium. He was even now lowering his hands back to his side as if he had simply clapped for their attention.\r\n\r\nLing Qi frowned as she studied the man. There was something about him which set her on edge. Perhaps it was his almost unnaturally bland and thin features, clean shaven down to the eyebrows, or the slightly gray tone of his skin. If she didn’t know better, she would think him ill.\r\n\r\n...Or maybe it was the eye searing shades of pink and lilac he was garbed in. It was bizarre seeing what looked like the robes of a high minister in such an undignified shade. How had someone wearing such loud colors gotten past her like that? There was no door down there, so he must have come through the same entrance she had.\r\n\r\nShe glanced over at Han Jian, but he didn’t seem particularly surprised. She forced herself to relax a bit. It was some form of magic obviously, and not something which anyone else seemed concerned about though a few of the students had been startled out of their seats.\r\n\r\n“Welcome to the Argent Peak Sect, children,” the strange, bald man said as he clasped his hands behind his back. His expression was one of careful neutrality, but she thought she could see amusement twinkling in his grey… no, green, no… in his eyes, which seemed to rapidly change colors.\r\n\r\n“I am Sect Elder Sima Jiao, Head of the Talisman Department, and it seems that it is my turn to greet our new arrivals.” So this man was the one in charge of creating talismans like the spirit repelling totems placed around villages and cities? He must be incredibly wealthy. No wonder he could get away with dressing so outlandishly.\r\n\r\nThen she remembered the ridiculous hat her driver had worn. Perhaps becoming Immortal compelled one to dress strangely? While Ling Qi pondered the fashion sense of cultivators, Elder Jiao had clasped his hands behind his back and was giving her and the other students an assessing look.\r\n\r\n“I am terribly busy on the best of days so I will not ramble on. To be honest, it is likely that the majority of you will never amount to anything beyond the outer sect where you stand now, and are thus... not particularly worthy of my time.” His blithe dismissal drew a grumble from the gathered students, Ling Qi among them. Han Jian’s serene expression didn’t change though. Perhaps he was simply that confident. Seeing that, Ling Qi let out a breath, reigning in her irritation.\r\n\r\n“It is simply reality. Nothing to be ashamed of,” the Elder continued, not unkindly. “In any case, your first years here will serve the purpose of separating those with only minor potential from those with true talent. This is why no one will be allowed to leave the sect grounds during the first year, nor will any correspondence be allowed in or out in the first three months.”\r\n\r\nThat seemed to surprise some of the other disciples, setting off a wave of whispers, though no one dared to openly question the elder. It didn’t bother Ling Qi though. What did she have outside this place? Perhaps she would enjoy a stroll through her original home when she had made something of herself, but until then, why bother?\r\n\r\n“Be silent,” Elder Jiao said then, pulling her attention back to him. “You will have time enough for mortal concerns later. Today and in the future, you are disciples of the Argent Peak. The foundation you lay in the first steps of your path will shape the rest of your lives. There is no need for distractions from the outside world.” His odd, color-shifting eyes swept over the room as his stern expression softened back into the same easy amusement he showed at the beginning of his speech.\r\n\r\n“The only other rule is that you may not kill or permanently maim your fellow disciples nor may you damage or steal sect property. In addition, there is to be absolutely no violence between you newcomers for the first three months. Conflict is important for your growth, but it would not do to allow potential to be cut off before it can even begin to bloom.”\r\n\r\nHis words, delivered in a light tone still sent a chill down Ling Qi’s spine. It seemed things wouldn’t be so different from home after all. She found herself eyeing her fellows in a new light, as possible enemies and obstacles.\r\n\r\nLing Qi was brought up short only when she saw Han Jian giving her a reassuring smile. Only then did she noticed that her hands resting on the desk in front of her had clenched nervously. She did her best to return her current companion’s smile, but the expression was a little wan.\r\n\r\nIt was unlikely that she could rely on someone whom she had only shared a brief conversation with. She managed to calm herself after another few moments; worrying for her safety was nothing new. Besides, the Elder was speaking again, and she needed to pay attention.\r\n\r\n“Each of you will be granted an allowance of five red spirit stones per month and access to the Argent Soul Art,” he continued, confusing her. She had no idea what either of those things were.\r\n\r\n“For those of you not aware,” he added, “spirit stones are the currency of the Immortals, more valuable than gold or silver.” Ling Qi was suddenly all too aware of the way his unsettling gaze rested on her before passing to a handful of other students in the room.\r\n\r\n“Cultivation requires the consumption of the energy in said stones, at least until one masters certain other arts. I would suggest frugality. As for the Argent Soul Art, it is the beginners form of the Sect’s cultivation art. It is exceptional for early growth, if somewhat less effective for mature cultivators.” The older man rolled his shoulders then and glanced toward the door.\r\n\r\n“All of your mortal necessities will be provided in the Sect at no further cost. Behind this building are two paths leading to the residential areas. You will be segregated by gender, of course.” He smiled as if amused by some private joke. “I would not suggest trespassing in the wrong zone. Rooming arrangements will be up to you, but expect to room with at least one other disciple. For the first three months, two Elders will be on the mountain to provide beginner’s training in, the physical and spiritual aspects of our arts respectively. I suggest you seek them out because you will need to earn such elder attention later.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\"All else will be up to you, your skill, and your talent.” He unclasped his hands and brought them back up to rest on the podium, but they were no longer empty. Instead, he held a large jewelry box made of dark green jade. “Now, if you would file up in an orderly fashion, I will be handing out your first month’s allowance.”\r\n\r\nAs she stood, preparing to join the forming line below, Han Jian spoke up quietly from beside her. He was now standing as well, and Ling Qi noted that she had been right. He was actually taller than her; it felt strange to look up at someone her own age. Heijin, his tiger cub had migrated from his head to his shoulder, clinging to the fabric with his…? little kitten claws. The tiger cub was still giving the impression of glaring at her.\r\n\r\n“Do you need a couple of pointers on getting started?,” he asked, sounding a bit awkward. “I couldn’t help but notice you aren’t actually awakened yet. You just seemed a little on edge, you know?” He followed Ling Qi as she stepped out into the aisle to join the line.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” Ling Qi responded after a moment. He had seemed friendly enough, and it wasn’t as if she had anything he could possibly want.\r\n\r\n“How would I contact you though?” Ling Qi asked.\r\n\r\nHe hummed thoughtfully as the line shuffled forward. “Hm, I’ll wait out in the front plaza here around noon tomorrow. That sound good? I’d rather not end up with last pick of the housing today.”\r\n\r\nShe supposed she didn’t have much choice in the matter. She nodded her assent and fell silent. Making conversation was more tiring than she thought.\r\n\r\nShe soon received her allowance of spirit stones and a scroll case containing her new ‘cultivation art’. No one had come out and said it, but she thought it likely that it was necessary for ‘awakening’ since they were giving it out to everyone. She would have to read it later, and practice. Perhaps she could surprise Han Jian come tomorrow? The thought was oddly pleasing.\r\n\r\nFor now though, Ling Qi thought as the line moved forward, she had to make sure that she would be able to keep these ‘gifts’. The first step to that would be seeing to her housing.\r\n'),

('System Day I', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 2, '\r\n\r\nA raw, primal scream was being wrenched from my throat, my mind and body wracked by pain. The pain of loss, the pain of death, the pain of ending.\r\n\r\nA crisp snap broke through my screaming, the pair of fingers that did the deed appearing in my vision. An old pair of fingers started the snap; a young pair of fingers ended the snap. I felt a strange force invade my mind, grab something, twist, and rip. I cried out in pain, a sense of loss washing over me. My mouth closed, every breath sending fresh flames of torment radiating from my lungs.\r\n\r\nA tall, thin man was in front of me, speaking. “I do really hate the screaming, but I suppose that’s what happens when you mortals die.”\r\n\r\nWait what!? Die!? I was in class just a second ago! What did he mean die!? I was too young to die! I could feel the panic quickly mounting again, my breath becoming shorter and faster as I started to hyperventilate.\r\n\r\n“Who are you? Where is this? What do you mean die!?”\r\n\r\nAs I shot my questions off rapid-fire, I looked around.\r\n\r\nI was disoriented. Dazed. Pain and anguish were clawing at my heart, my mind, my very soul, but slowly, oh so slowly, it was starting to fade.\r\n\r\nUntil I noticed where I was. And where I wasn’t.\r\n\r\nThen it all came rushing back, and while I’d been silenced nothing stopped me from hyperventilating there’snoairhereohmygod!\r\n\r\nA pair of fingers snapped again, and the man spoke once more, derision dripping from the single word he uttered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Honestly.”\r\n\r\nMy mind cleared.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI wasn’t sure where I was anymore – I seemed to be floating in space, surrounded by twinkling stars and galaxies, comets and planets. It wasn’t home, it wasn’t school, it wasn’t even earth. There was nobody present except the tall thin man, floating impossibly in front of me, looking both ancient and young, happy and sad, male and female, tall and short, fat and skinny, red and blue – wait what?\r\n\r\nI pinched myself, putting all my might into it. Only thing to do really. This dream was way too trippy for me.\r\n\r\nI jumped as an electric shock went through me. I was still here, wherever here was. That didn’t bode well.\r\n\r\nI might be in a minor spot of serious trouble.\r\n\r\nA deep, long-suffering sigh escaped him? Her?\r\n\r\n“You died. I took the memory of you dying to calm you down. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to have worked nearly as well as it should’ve.”, and I heard, barely under her breath “Mortals.”\r\n\r\nI felt an enforced calmness come over me, my panic not going away, just… not mattering anymore. Given where I was, strange floating among the stars with what can only be described as a super powerful shape-shifter, I could believe I had died. This wasn’t Kansas anymore.\r\n\r\n“Now then, we can have a discussion. You have died. Your soul has failed to properly re-enter the cycle of reincarnation, and I found you just floating in the void.”\r\n\r\nTheir face twisted in an unhappy grimace, and I felt an instinctive fear run through my…\r\n\r\nDid I even have a body anymore? Was I just a soul now?\r\n\r\nI didn\'t know what to make of being told I’d died, that my life was over. I did know that I hadn’t been old, or even middle-aged when I died. Had I even made it to adulthood!? I tried to make a disgruntled noise – the enforced calm was preventing any sort of outrage, only to discover that I couldn’t make a sound.\r\n\r\nThat bastard.\r\n\r\nWe couldn’t have a ‘discussion’ if I couldn’t say a single word! I guess he just wanted to monologue, and my input could take a jolly hike.\r\n\r\n“I’m Papilion, the God of Change,” she grandly announced, to an audience of one – and that constant shifting of male to female, young to old, pleased to outraged made a bit more sense, although it was giving me a pounding headache to follow. “And you’re being reincarnated. Normally, as souls are reincarnated through the cycle of life and death, all of their memories are erased. They’re given a clean slate to start over. I don’t know what to make of you, a lone soul lost to Samsara, so you have the option of keeping some of your memories. Regrettably, a newborn’s mind is simply too small for all of the things you know, and you do know quite a few dangerous things. What is your choice? Would you like to start as a blank slate, a new life? Or keep some of your knowledge, some of who you are, knowing that you’ll never be able to go back, be forever incomplete, missing a part of yourself?”\r\n\r\nI wasn’t ready to make a decision of this scale. Hell, 10 minutes ago by my reckoning, I was debating what to eat for lunch, deciding if I wanted to buy that dress or not, and figuring out how to get all my homework done!\r\n\r\nPoof! Like a magician’s disappearing act, it was all gone! A mote of dust in the breeze, smoke wrapped in the wind, the last ember soaked in water.\r\n\r\nMy entire life was over. Everything I’d worked for and accomplished gone in a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nThe crushing weight of that threatened to overwhelm me, but then the absurdity hit.\r\n\r\nI was dead. It wasn’t like I could make any worse choices now, could I?\r\n\r\nWhat was the worst that could happen now?\r\n\r\nOn one hand, I could keep my memories. Sounded painful, more emotional than physical. I would lose everyone I had ever known – my parents, my best friend, my brother, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends – everyone. I would know it. I would be aware. It was like a plague went through and I had to attend a hundred funerals at once, but the only funeral anyone would be attending was mine. The option to just… forget… was tempting, especially if it was as thorough as removing the memory of me dying was.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it sounded like this was a rare chance. Not everyone got to keep their memories – even if it was only a fraction of them – and start over again, tabula rasa. It was tempting, just for the aspect of doing something nobody – wait, maybe this had happened before – had done.\r\n\r\n“Can… can I ask some questions….?” I asked, getting a single arched eyebrow back as a response. That might be a “go ahead”, but it might also be a “you dare question me mortal”, and I wasn’t going to play games with my life. Err… afterlife? Soul? Reincarnation?\r\n\r\nI decided not to ask any questions, and mull it over myself. There wasn’t much more to add.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I felt that the choice was forced. As some famous philosopher said “You die twice. Once when you die, and once when someone speaks your name for the last time.” I might have died and lost my first body, but my soul and memories were intact. That was alive enough for me, and I fully intended to keep it that way. I was too young to die.\r\n\r\n“I would like to keep my memories.” I said with far more confidence than I felt. The god in front of me smiled as he started to morph into a strange bird – it looked like a crow, but it had too many feet. Somehow, his voice was all the same coming out of a beak.\r\n\r\n“Right then. Chemistry, gone. Physics, gone. Far too dangerous to know that where you’re going. Scientific method – you can do too much damage with that. Broad strokes of history – fine, but the details are completely superfluous, and we need to make room. Mathematics – keep the basics, but calculus will do nothing for you where you’re headed. Arts, literature – useless, but removing it will change you too much. There’s not much point in letting you keep your memories if you’re a completely different person. Interpersonal relationships – they can stay, same reason. English – I suppose you need a starting baseline. French? Spanish? Entirely useless. Gone. Hmm… a few more things to clean up… and we’re done! Prepare to be reincarnated as a Golden Crow.”\r\n\r\nI felt the strange force from before entering my mind, magnitudes more powerful and painful than before, rooting around in my head. Each time the crow squawked, I felt something rip out from my mind, and I tried to hold back tears of pain. By the time math was gone – I never liked it, but was indescribably sad at it leaving – I was curled up on the floor weeping silently. Not that there was a floor, just more floating in space. But when he said ‘Prepare to be reincarnated as a Golden Crow” I shot up, panic racing through me, somehow about to speak again.\r\n\r\n“NO! I WANT TO BE HUMAN! MAKE ME HUMAN! HUMA-“\r\n\r\nA pair of fingers snapped.\r\n\r\nI was floating in warm, wet darkness. I had been floating here for quite some time, and I was doing lots of thinking. My first instinct was that it was all a bad dream, but I had fallen asleep and woken up too often for that to be the case. So, it seemed like I had truly died, and was being reincarnated.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I was unsure about was if I was going to be human, a ‘Golden Crow’, whatever that was, or something else entirely. This whole reincarnation thing really needed a user manual or something. I didn’t seem to have a shell, but there was no telling really.\r\n\r\nAt least, I was pretty sure something called a crow would be hatched from an egg. Who knew what I actually knew and what got ripped out by that cruel, capricious god. Who knew what was real, and what I just made up on my own as I floated here in the dark, trying desperately to plug the holes in my memories, holes where I knew things should be but were not.\r\n\r\nI wanted to go home. I wanted to see mom again. I wanted dad to hug me, to tell me everything was going to be ok. Maybe I could look them up on the internet when I was old enough, tell them that I was ok. Would they even believe me? Would they think it’s just some cruel hoax?\r\n\r\nI could probably tell them enough about me, enough about them, growing up. How the sun hit the windows, how it would go through the crude ‘stained glass’ plastic I made in 4th grade. That Becky was my best friend until 2nd grade, when she moved. How our dog Aoife used to eat anything and everything – proven by the Great Banana Peel Experiment – and was taken too soon. What was an ‘experiment’ anyways?\r\n\r\nThe fact that some knowledge was considered “too dangerous” for where I was going implied that I wasn’t heading back to the time I came from. I thinly tried to hold on hope that Papilion had meant “too dangerous to be born knowing so much”, but I knew I was just deluding myself. I grieved. I lamented. I cursed fate, cursed the gods. It changed nothing. They were most likely all lost to me.\r\n\r\nWaking period by waking period, the details of my past life got dulled, along with the pain of losing everyone I knew. Random things stayed – like why did I still know my bus schedule? How did that stay, why didn’t it get stripped out? Others faded. I could only name half of the people in my biology class, I had no idea who my teachers were last year, and the details of the latest book I had been reading were gone.\r\n\r\nGod, I wanted to read again. To pick up a book, sit in a cozy chair by the fire, and just lose myself in the pages. Rarely was I so happy as when I was reading. Although, “God” might be a bit of a strange epithet, after now knowing there were gods, and it didn’t seem like there was just one. Otherwise he (she? Them? What pronoun did a shape-shifting god (goddess??) use anyways? – I decided to use he, since that was the first and the last form shown to save my sanity until said god of change told me otherwise.) probably wouldn’t have referred to himself as “the god of change”, and probably just “god”. God. This was tricky.\r\n\r\nI had entirely too much time to think, and nothing else to do. I tried flailing about now and then, just for a change of pace, but I rapidly hit soft walls all around me that absorbed what I did and gave. I tried to brace myself and push out, but had no luck. I would rapidly tire out and fall asleep after each attempt.\r\n\r\nI kept at it though, because there was nothing else to do. Except think. And there was nobody to bounce my thoughts off of, nobody to interact with, and just far too much time on my hands (claws? Please not claws.) God. Gods.\r\n\r\nI occasionally heard noises, as if coming off from a great distance underwater, but couldn’t make anything out. I would redouble my escape efforts whenever I heard that – maybe someone could let me out? But it never made a difference. The noises were usually soothing, which was nice, but being unable to really make anything out, it wasn’t that much of a change. At least it broke up the monotony. Inevitably after each attempt, I would get exhausted and fall asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen would this end?\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs couldn’t last, and one day I felt the fleshy walls of my prison contract around me, squeezing me. I felt a sharp spike of fear go through me, and I flailed more in panic. There wasn’t anything else I could do. This did seem to strongly imply that I didn’t need to escape with a beak, which gave me a brief sense of relief – only for panic to set in once again as the walls contracted around me, squeezing all over. Again, and again, pain and pause, the relief between each movement constantly shortened. I was battered, I felt bruised all over, but finally, with one last massive squeeze, I emerged into the world, and a massive deluge of information.\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Welcome to Pallos!]\r\n\r\n[Name: Elaine]\r\n\r\n[Race: Human]\r\n\r\n[Age: 0]\r\n\r\n[Time remaining on System locks: 68,820:43:16]\r\n\r\n[*ding!* Due to the great efforts of [Hero] Herculix, you get a +1 bonus to all stats!

But more than that –\r\n\r\nGiants. Giants all around me. Some yelling, some screaming, two covered in blood. The noise grated, and went right between my ears, nails on chalkboard. I was picked up, incomprehensible language babbled all around me, and looking down, I saw a female giant bleeding profusely. Another giantess elbowed her way in, put her hand on the first giant, yelled something, and I watched the flesh of the first giant knit itself back together!\r\n\r\nHoly shitballs there was magic here!\r\n\r\nI looked up for the first time, and realized that we were in a field under the open sky. I was passed down to the giantess who was healed, my head being moved around as I saw more of the night sky, and I saw them.\r\n\r\nTwo crimson cat’s eyes with slitted pupils glared down from the sky to me, watching me, seeing every movement I made. I could feel the weight of its ominous gaze pressing on me, suffocating. The strange floating words, being manhandled by giants, the screaming, getting battered and bruised, the blood, the magic - it was too much. I screamed and cried and flailed about, and didn’t stop until my voice gave out and I passed out from exhaustion.\r\n\r\n'),
('System Day II', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 3, '\r\n\r\nDad came home, had dinner, wished me luck on System Day, got out of his armor, and went directly to sleep. In that order. The last two items had occasionally been mixed up. Mom always made me rewash the sheets when it happened, and I’d quickly learned to intercept dad before he could sleep in his armor.\r\n\r\nWashing sheets SUCKED.\r\n\r\nTime was funny without clocks. Things weren’t done at a particular time, just “Around noon” “Before dark” “Right after sunrise”. After so long of not needing to deal with being exactly on time to things, it was easy to slide right into the new way of handling time. It did make starting important things – like System Day – a bit tricky, but such was the way of life.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t figure out why my System clock was measured in hours – the same hours as on Earth – but nobody seemed to use hours, nor did I even know the name for it here! Learning the new language had been hard. I didn’t want to ask about time and hours and such – I could always let the reincarnated genie out of the bottle, but there was no putting it back. It wasn’t like I was keeping it a massive “don’t tell at any cost” secret, but I figured there was a time and a place for everything.\r\n\r\n“Elaine. Sit.” Mom gestured to the chair, comb in hand. I happily scuttled up onto the recliner, where mom started to comb my hair. It was peaceful, relaxing, stroke after stroke getting my hair out and loose. A moment of peace. A moment of calm. A perfect mother-daughter moment.\r\n\r\n“Excited?” Mom asked, getting a particularly difficult snarl out.\r\n\r\n“Yeah!” This was IT! This was the big day! “I can’t wait to try all of the things in the temple out! I want to know everything!”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMom smiled. “Don’t get your hopes up too high, it’s fairly disappointing really.”\r\n\r\nLearning about magic, disappointing? Yikes. I hope I didn’t have all the fun sucked out of me when I grew up. At long last. Growing up was taking me literally twice as long as the normal person, thankyouverymuch reincarnation.\r\n\r\nJust as I’d started to taste the fun and joys of being an adult, ziiiiiip! Back to square one! If it hadn’t been for the trippy stars and gods nonsense, I would’ve sworn someone had it in for me!\r\n\r\nBut nooooooo. I’d been a clerical error! A typo!!\r\n\r\nHair finished up, I grabbed my sandals, and off we went! We left the house, looked both ways, and crossed over to the “grey zone” of the street. I frowned.\r\n\r\n“Moooooom, can we not walk here? It’s System Day! I’m allowed to walk in the real street now!”\r\n\r\nMom gave me that half amused, half exasperated smile. “I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”\r\n\r\nI gave her my best angry-pout.\r\n\r\n“Because I don’t have enough physical stats.” I recited as annoyingly as I could.\r\n\r\n“That’s right. And when has ‘not being allowed’ ever stopped you or Lyra from anything, hmm?”\r\n\r\nOops. Good point.\r\n\r\nI pouted as I was dragged along. I wanted to be on the real street, instead of the tiny grey zone. It was full of other kids, crates, and generally things pushed to the side. It seemed to be a universal law that bike lanes were treated poorly. I hated having to crawl over and around things, when I could be in the nice “white zone” instead, strolling through without a care in the world.\r\n\r\nOut of the clear blue sky, a massive series of thunderbolts came down near the south gate, making me jump about a foot out of my skin.\r\n\r\n“What was that!?” I yelled, startled. Lightning bolts didn’t just come out of the clear blue sky. No way.\r\n\r\nNot even in this world of MAGIC! Most of what I’d seen had been on the smaller end. Plates instantly cleaned. People working faster, hitting harder. I hadn’t seen any super-duper-cool magic like LIGHTNING BOLTS OUTTA NOWHERE!\r\n\r\nBut… maybe I had?\r\n\r\nI wasn’t the only one who’d jumped. Multiple huge surprise lightning bolts tended to do that to people.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think it was, Elaine?\" Mom asked me with that annoying \'I\'m trying to teach you something\' tone of voice parents had.\r\n\r\nI bit my lower lip and thought about it.\r\n\r\n\"A... Classer entering the city?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nMom nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Why did he make some Lightning bolts?\"\r\n\r\nOh! OH! I knew this one! Dad had told me!\r\n\r\n\"They ask mage Classers to discharge their mana before coming in!\" I exclaimed, jumping one in my excitement. Dad was SUPER GUARD! He told me cool guard stuff like that!\r\n\r\nAnd, and, someone could just flat-out summon Lightning bolts! That was MAGIC! YES!\r\n\r\nA thought came to me.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell how much mana someone has?”\r\n\r\n“It’s usually safe to assume that mages have a lot of mana.” Mom said, and I wanted to roll my eyes.\r\n\r\nDUH mages had mana!! What else would they have? Even with the great “don’t tell kids stuff” conspiracy going on, that seemed suuuuuuuuuper obvious to me.\r\n\r\n“The guards have a rough idea of how much mana mages of a certain level should have. However, it’s something of a trust system. Mages show that they can follow the rules, so they’re let in.”\r\n\r\nI guess?\r\n\r\nWe reached the end of the street, and turned left into the main street. You could see the town gate on one end, and the market at the center of town on the other. Well – you could see it if there weren’t food stands, vendors, two wagon-wide worth of lanes, and a massive crush of people in the way.\r\n\r\nMagic was on display in hundreds of tiny ways. Shops had their flashing signs, food rotated on spits without anyone touching them, goods moved through the air by themselves, and a broken wagon was repaired by a passing man touching it.\r\n\r\nEveryone had magic, usually small, and used it in their day to day life.\r\n\r\nI’d seen the sight a THOUSAND times, and there were still a THOUSAND COOL THINGS TO SEE! Every day had something new and different!\r\n\r\n“Mom Mom Mom look! They’re selling pitas! And a bard’s playing over on the corner! Can we go over and listen? Please? Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease?”\r\n\r\nMom rolled her eyes at me “You’re as distractible as always Elaine. Where are we going right now?”\r\n\r\n“The temple!”\r\n\r\n“And why are we going there?”\r\n\r\nRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“SYSTEM DAY!!! Let’s go-go-go-go slowpoke”\r\n\r\nShe chuckled as I started pulling on her hand and arm, urging her forward. I knew she could run and go so much faster than this, why were we plodding along?\r\n\r\nI suddenly stumbled and nearly fell over as a blast of wind hit me. Fortunately, mom was holding onto me, and kept me stable and up. My heart was pounding so loudly I could almost hear it. My palms felt like they were going to slip out of mom’s tight grasp.\r\n\r\nMom looked down at me with a hint of worry in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“That was a courier. And that is why we’re still walking in the grey zone. You could barely stand the air blast of him running by – imagine if he hadn’t seen you in the crowd and ran into you at that speed? That would be bad.”\r\n\r\nI imagined a large, rolling rock and a small, delicate mango in the way. Splat. Yeah no.\r\n\r\nMy heart was getting back down to a more reasonable rate.\r\n\r\n“I’m never leaving the grey zone. Nuh uh. No way.” I swore.\r\n\r\nI climbed up and over another crate while mom deftly weaved from the grey zone into the white zone and back again to avoid it. I could smell the marketplace, and now I could finally see it. It was a large, sprawling mess in the middle of town, with the Athahurst river pressed up against one side of it. Guards were patrolling around with their leather vests and metal batons, merchants were hawking their wares under covered stalls, shooting off impressive displays of magic to try and attract attention – pillars of flames, living sculptures of water, flashing light signs, and so much more. The usual army recruiter was shouting his pitch – “Join the legions today! Fight the Formorians! Service grants citizenship!” A large crowd of people moved throughout, going from stall to stall to do their daily shopping, find something nice, or just to chit-chat. The sky went dark, and everyone froze where they were, merchant to farmer, young to old, man and woman, looking to the sky. Street kids didn’t even take the chance of distraction to nick a purse or two – they were too busy looking up as well.\r\n\r\nJust a crapton of pigeons. They were so shitty to have around. Literally, they pooped everywhere. There was a collective sigh, as the market resumed being as busy as a beehive.\r\n\r\nThe market was too narrow and too crowded for there to be grey zones, and it was somewhat dangerous for someone as small as I was for a reason. Fortunately, with the crowd, and everyone stopping and starting every three feet it was safe for me. It clearly wasn’t stopping some of the street kids I saw ducking and weaving about, looking for unguarded wares and purses. I eyed them suspiciously. Mom might not be paying too much attention, but I was. No sticky-fingered brat was getting mom’s pouch – and by extension, my lunch.\r\n\r\nWith supernatural agility mom worked her way through the crowd, and we reached the shores of the Athahurst. We ended up close to the south bridge, with a pair of surly guards stopping enterprising merchants from setting up on the bridge itself.\r\n\r\nWe started to cross the bridge when mom, twisting with unnatural finesse, punted a wind weasel that had been blowing towards us.\r\n\r\n“Bloody pests,” she muttered, putting me back down. “What is the guard doing that there’s so many of them running around?”\r\n\r\n“You should complain to dad that he is not doing his job.” I cheekily replied, only to get walloped over the head.\r\n\r\nI rubbed my head, and waited until mom had turned before glaring at her.\r\n\r\nGlaring over her shoulders at the bridge guards, muttering darkly under her breath, we continued marching over the bridge. This was exciting! System day! Some old men we wearing tunics of various hues of red and blue were fishing on the bridge.\r\n\r\n“Hey mom! Can we go fishing here later!?” Trout and salmon and ok fine I didn’t actually know the names of any of the fish here. A fish was a fish. Yum Yum.\r\n\r\nI got a sad smile back.\r\n\r\n“No dear. Who’s allowed to fish here again?” My face fell at this.\r\n\r\n“Citizens…” I muttered back, still glaring murder at the two fishermen. The JERKS were allowed to fish here and I wasn’t.\r\n\r\nMom, clearly seeing I was upset, tried to cheer me up. “Besides, the fishing here is pretty bad – there’s almost nothing in the river because of the grates.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not fair that we’re not citizens! Dad should be a citizen, the army recruiter said they become citizens and he is a guard! I want to be a citizen!” I whined.\r\n\r\n“Even if dad was a citizen…” Mom started, trailing off.\r\n\r\nShe knew me too well.\r\n\r\nWe weren’t allowed to be citizens. Ever since the day I’d learned that simply being born a girl made me a second class citizen, a roaring bonfire of rage and anger had been lit inside of me. It fueled me, drove me. No matter how many times I got punched and kicked, I leaned on that anger and always, always got back up.\r\n\r\nMom was always good with the patients who came to visit her, and could probably tell I was still upset.\r\n\r\n“Look Elaine, while you can’t be a citizen, you could always marry one! It’s practically the same thing.”\r\n\r\nThe only thing that did was to stroke the fire inside of me, and make me mad again. Mom had told me that before, and it just didn’t help.\r\n\r\nAt all. I wasn’t going to marry no stinky boy just to get second-rate citizenship. Bah!\r\n\r\nCalm, calm, I need to stay calm. I need to stay in control. I can’t just go flying off the handle, and the temple was practically in sight.\r\n\r\nSystem Day. Mangos. Lyra. Magic. Happy thoughts.\r\n\r\nAs I was seeing red and taking some deep stabilizing breaths, we reached the end of the bridge and arrived in front of the temple. It was the largest building I had seen since I had been reborn, and looked like it had been a clone of a Greek temple, with large steps leading up to majestic marble pillars. I stopped and stared for a moment, taking it all in, before noticing a statue in front of the building. Flesh in marble, done by such a skilled [Sculptor] that he looked alive, a large lizard-like creature stood hunched forward on its hind legs, a jaw like a crocodile with a smile like one, claws made for rending and tearing, and a huge sail on its back.\r\n\r\nWe reverently bowed towards the statue of Etalix, the Storm. One of the guardian beasts. No idea what a guardian beast was or what they did, but I was taking no chances. Not with the gods being real, and seemingly taking an active interest in our day to day lives.\r\n\r\nUntil I had an answer, I wasn’t going to stop paying my respects to Etalix. Just in case.\r\n\r\nEtalix, the Storm.\r\n\r\nEtalix, the Spinosaurus.\r\n\r\nThere were freaking DINOSAURS here!\r\n\r\n');

('System Day III', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 4, '\r\n\r\nWe entered the temple together, and I looked around in awe. I wasn’t particularly religious - somewhat ironic, considering I’d met an actual god - but the temple was impressive, no matter how many times I saw it.\r\n\r\nThere were marble pillars, and in the middle of the entryway, a large diamond-shaped symbol, with a gemstone on each corner and one in the middle. Painted frescos lined the wall: What was probably Etalix, wrapped in mist. Herculix fighting some sort of large dinosaur. White Dove and Black Crow, the grim reapers from above. Army legions victorious over large insects. The famous run of Fulguris. The Sentinel Gideon, burning with the dark flames he was famous for. And many, many more, each probably with historical significance and martial victory that someone would probably be all too happy to tell me about if I asked. I didn’t ask.\r\n\r\nI wanted to read about it! No books, just nice scrolls, and even then nobody had any ideas of teaching me how to read. I’d have to do it myself one day.\r\n\r\n“Good morning.” A man with a pockmarked face, marking him as a survivor of any number of the poxes and plagues that went about regularly, greeted us. “Are you here for System Day?” He asked with exceeding politeness.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” I responded as enthusiastically as I could, although not as loudly as possible. The temple was intimidating. At the same time, mom gave a much more reserved “Yes”. I glared at her with all the ferocity I could muster. It was my day. No stealing it!\r\n\r\n“Third door on the left.” He gently told us.\r\n\r\nWith bold strides and butterflies bouncing in my belly, I entered the indicated room. There were three other kids in beige sitting on the floor in front of an older priestly-looking gentleman in a chair, and there were various implements scattered around the edge of the room. There was a bowl of water, a hammer, a rope, and dozens more little objects scattered all over. There was even a modest patch of dirt! At the back of the room, prominently displayed, was another one of those diamonds with 5 gems in it, but much smaller. I looked around puzzled as everyone’s attention came around to me.\r\n\r\n“Hello there. I’m Sacerdus. What’s your name?”\r\n\r\nI got a warm fuzzy feeling from the elderly priest standing at the front of the room. He was tall, in a long white robe with simple sandals on his feet. White hair, white beard, and it was clear he spent time in the sun, he practically radiated comfort, confidence, and relaxation. Heck, for all I knew, he literally was radiating all of those!\r\n\r\n“I’m Elaine.” I fidgeted, eyes on the floor.\r\n\r\n“Well Elaine, why don’t you sit down with everyone else? We’ll get started soon.”\r\n\r\nI looked around, and saw Lyra! How did I miss her first-time round? Her somewhat tattered tunic made her stand out, the victim of one of her many fights. She clearly saw me as well, and jumped up to hug me!\r\n\r\n“Lyra!” I exclaimed, completely forgetting where we were.\r\n\r\n“Elaine!” Just as happily.\r\n\r\n“Ahem.” A cough came from Sacerdus. Mom was glaring murder at me. Oh gods I was going to get the spoon later.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I was spared further conversation as a boy wearing a green tunic and his father came in.\r\n\r\n“Hello there. I’m Sacerdus. What’s your name?” Sacerdus said again, without any sign of impatience or annoyance.\r\n\r\nThe boy drew himself up to his full height, and with all the haughtiness he could muster responded with “Olympus Kerberos Titus.” I rolled my eyes to myself as he strutted forward, and plonked himself down in front of all of us. Um, hello? The remaining four of us are sitting in a line, who are you to sit in front of us all? Should I say something? But Sacerdus isn’t saying anything, he’s just keeping his happy smile on.\r\n\r\nAs I was debating what to do, Sacerdus preempted me by talking.\r\n\r\n“Well! I’m glad to see everyone’s here. Just checking – everyone has less than seven days left on their timer? Raise your hand if you do!” He said as he raised his hand in demonstration.\r\n\r\n64 hours and change left. Yup, that was me! Strange that he didn’t say it in hours, although nobody here seemed to use them. I raised my hand with everyone else.\r\n\r\n“Good! Let’s begin. First, I’d like to say thank you to Kerberos’s father, Citizen Prasinos. He, and Citizen Arotro and Citizen Fyto together grow about three in ten crops that we eat here in Aquiliea.” He gestured to three men standing in the back in full purple robes.\r\n\r\nThe three citizens in the back nodded thanks at the acknowledgement.\r\n\r\nSacerdus turned around, and grabbed a scroll off of the altar.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to start by something our history off of the something.”\r\n\r\nI was still learning words. Sue me, I was a kid, and hadn’t gotten exposed to everything yet. However, it was easy enough to figure new words out from context!\r\n\r\nHe unraveled the scroll, and started reading off of it. “It’s currently 4788 years post-creation. In the beginning, the five major gods created…” I completely missed everything else he said – at long last, I had the word for reading, and the word for scroll! It wasn’t a book, but I could now finally ask for reading lessons! Books would have to be involved, and then I could finally read again!\r\n\r\nI hadn’t seen Lyra in ages (ok fine two days), and we spent some time putting our heads together, whispering frantically to get caught up.\r\n\r\n“Did you get in trouble for the…?” I started. I didn’t need to finish the sentence; Lyra knew exactly what I was referring to. The latest Incident. The reason it had been two whole days since last seeing the other half of my soul.\r\n\r\n“Nope!” She cheekily grinned.\r\n\r\n“Lucky.” I muttered back. “You NEVER get in trouble for ANYTHING.”\r\n\r\nWhich was true. No matter how bad the situation, no matter what we got up to, it was one of the fundamental truths of the world that mom would punish me, and Lyra got away free.\r\n\r\n“Any questions?” he asked. Shit. I had completely missed everything he said! This was System Day! I needed to focus! I did my best poker face, hoping that I hadn’t missed anything, and more importantly, mom hadn’t noticed me whispering with Lyra.\r\n\r\n“Good. Moving on. We don’t know where the System comes from, but it’s what gives us classes and skills. It’s what lets us stay alive in this world. It’s the foundation of nearly everything we do, and we’d fall prey to the creatures outside of our borders without it. Even with it, we’re at risk. Everyone needs to do their part so humanity as a whole can survive, and maybe even beat the Formorians.”\r\n\r\nFormorians. The villain of every story, the scourge seemingly lurking around every corner. The big monster, threatening to overrun us at any time.\r\n\r\nI’d never seen one. When I was with dad I occasionally saw a bunch of new soldier recruits marching out of the city, and once in a while an old soldier came back. There was a war, but it wasn’t near us.\r\n\r\n“Nearly everything has a System. Anything bigger than a bug has a system, although it seems like only humans and intelligent monsters get classes. As you’ve all noticed,” he chuckled “when you’re born, your System is locked. Humans all have the same timer, but it seems like monsters each get their own, different timer. Why this is, we don’t know, but we believe it’s to stop babies from killing themselves.” Sacerdus went from smiling to serious. “If you get nothing else out of System Day, just know that improperly using the System and allocating your traits can and will kill you. Each time you level up a physical trait, you lose some of your mana regeneration. If you allow your mana regeneration to dip below 0, you’ll start to burn mana just to stay alive. You’ll quickly hit 0 mana, and then your body will eat itself from the inside out. It’s not pretty. It’s not fun. It’s Very Bad.” He emphasized, talking to us like we were children.\r\n\r\nWhich we were. Fair enough.\r\n\r\nSacerdus repeated himself, along with dire warnings about allocating stats.\r\n\r\n“Any questions?”\r\n\r\nI looked over my stats.\r\n\r\n[Free Stats: 0]\r\n\r\n[Strength: 4]\r\n\r\n[Dexterity: 6]\r\n\r\n[Vitality: 3]\r\n\r\n[Speed: 4]\r\n\r\n[Mana: 2]\r\n\r\n[Mana Regeneration:2]\r\n\r\n[Magic Power: 2]\r\n\r\n[Magic Control: 2]\r\n\r\nI had nothing.\r\n\r\n“Carrying on. There are two types of stats, broadly speaking. There are the stats you get and build yourself, the ‘natural’ stats. And the stats you get from classes and leveling, the ‘class’ stats. For the most part, you can’t control your natural stats, and they’ll only form a very minor portion of your stats. However, as a benefit, they don’t drain any mana. Otherwise very few of us would survive our System unlocking.”\r\n\r\nI spent a moment daydreaming and thinking over what was said before realizing Sacerdus was talking again. Shit. I couldn’t miss this, not when lacking information could kill me it seemed. Stupid kid brain.\r\n\r\n“… to recap, each point of mana regeneration gives you about 240 mana per day of regeneration. Each point you allocate to Strength, Dexterity, Vitality, or Speed will use about 24 mana per day worth of that regeneration.”\r\n\r\nI mentally translated that to about 10 mana/hour gained per point and 1 mana/hour lost per physical stat.\r\n\r\n“Let’s talk about the stat groupings.”\r\n\r\n“We have the four physical stats – Strength, Dexterity, Vitality and Speed. We then have the four magic stats – Mana, Mana Regen, Magic Power, and Magic Control. Any questions?”\r\n\r\nHeads shaking.\r\n\r\n“Next, we have the support stats and the direct stats. The direct stats directly help in fights, and the support stats simply help out.”\r\n\r\n“The four direct stats are Strength, Dexterity, Magic Power, and Magic Control. As a result, the four support stats are Vitality, Speed, Mana, and Mana Regeneration. Any questions?” The distinction seemed fairly arbitrary to me, but whatever, I would roll with it.\r\n\r\n“Good. Let’s talk about each individual stat now.”\r\n\r\n“Strength. Strength is how strong you are, how much you can lift, how powerfully you can swing a sword, how far you can draw a bow. It’s both how high you can lift a hammer, and how many times you can lift a hammer. It’s power, it’s stamina, it’s strength.”\r\n\r\n“Dexterity. Dexterity is how flexible you are, how gracefully you can move. Dexterity is the fine control over yourself, and over your movements. It’s how well you can etch pottery. It’s how accurate your arrow is. It’s how you balance as you walk. As it combines with Strength, it’s how accurately you hit the metal you’re forging, it’s how well-placed your blow against a Formorian is. Dexterity is grace. Dexterity is beauty.”\r\n\r\n“Vitality. Vitality is how well-put together you are. It’s thick skin. It’s health. It’s living a long life. It’s staving off disease. It’s how well you perceive the world around you. Vitality is recovering from injuries, recovering from a punch, easily bearing a child.”\r\n\r\nI frowned. It seemed more subtle than Strength or Dexterity. I guess that is why it was a support stat, and not a direct stat. Still, everything was useful. With great effort, I continued to pay attention.\r\n\r\n“Lastly in the physical stats we have speed. Speed is how fast you run. Speed is how fast your blade is. Speed is how quick your reflexes are. Speed is reaction, speed is how quickly you can make food, speed is how fast you set up your stall.” Sacerdus looked at the boy on the far side of the line, opposite to me. “Speed is how fast you run away with a purse.” He looked guilty for some reason.\r\n\r\n“Speed and Vitality need each other like Strength and Dexterity need each other, even though they oppose each other. You can get a ton of speed, but it’s useless without the perception granted by Vitality to keep up. In other words, if you had a ton of Speed but no Vitality, you literally wouldn’t be able to see yourself running.”\r\n\r\n“Now we’ll talk about the four magic stats. The magic stats are how all of your skills work.”\r\n\r\n“Mana. Mana is the fuel for your skills. Without enough mana, you can’t use the skill! Usually, you’ll be told how much a skill costs, and if you have enough mana, you can cast it! If you have lots and lots of mana, you can cast many many spells and skills at once! For every one point you put into mana, you get 10 points into your mana pool.”\r\n\r\nSeemed straightforward.\r\n\r\n“Mana regeneration is both how much mana you recover, and how the rest of your skills are fueled. Each point of mana regeneration gives you 240 mana per day of regeneration, and those points of mana per day of regeneration are how you fuel your physical skills. You can focus on physical stats, and use skills less often, or you can have fewer physical stats and be able to cast spells more often. However, you’re still limited by your mana pool for how many skills you can cast at once! Physical stats let you keep working for the entire day, but each activity isn’t as impressive as a skill.”\r\n\r\n“If you have questions, ask your parents later.” Sacerdus smiled at us. “I know this is a lot, but take some time to think about it, and ask later. This is supposed to be an introduction – after all, your parents know much better than you or I do what you should do!”\r\n\r\n“Magic power,” Sacerdus plowed on. “is how powerful skills can be, and how much mana a single skill can use. Many skills can use more mana the higher your magic power is. For example, the legion’s famous [Earthen Artillery] skill gets bigger the more mana you pour into it.”\r\n\r\nGot it. More magic power = bigger fireballs. Really all that mattered.\r\n\r\n“Lastly is Magic Control. This is how finely you can control your skills, how well you can weave them. If a sculptor wanted to use his [Fine Engraving] skill to make detailed work into a wall, he’d need a very high Magic Control level to make a fine, delicate pattern. For girls, a [Weave Lace] skill will get you finer and finer lace the higher your Magic Control skill is.”\r\n\r\nI wasn’t going to spend my precious time and magic making lace. Although, thinking about it, maybe I could get a skill to help with my hair.\r\n\r\n“To recap. Magic power is how powerful your skills can be. Magic control is how well you can control your skills. Mana controls your mana pool, and mana regen fuels it all”\r\n\r\n“Now, to finish this all off, I need to let you know about trade-offs. For every 8 points in Magic Power you get, you’ll lose a point of Magic Control. For every 8 points of Magic Control you get, you’ll lose a point of Magic Power. The same is true for Strength and Dexterity. For every eight points of Strength, you’ll lose one of Dexterity, and vice-versa. This only applies to the ‘class’ stats – your ‘natural’ stats don’t change. Any questions?”\r\n\r\nA flurry of questions erupted from the other kids, while I sat and pondered the System. It really did seem like you could be physical, and quite good at it, or magical, while weak physically. Could you do both? Would it be worse than either? How did I want to build my stats? If I wanted to be Elaine, the [Archmage], probably deep into the Magic stats. But did I want to focus on power, or control? Big mana pools, or good regen? Or could I have it all? Arghhh… I needed to know more. First reading. Then books. Then plotting. Then…. I swear I could feel steam coming out of my ears as I tried to digest everything I had just been given.\r\n'),
('System Day IV', 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons', 5, '\r\n\r\n“Ok! Now that we have that out of the way, let’s talk about elements!” Elements? Ooooh, more cool things! I wanted a fire element! Fireballs!\r\n\r\nI’d seen a few merchants having flaming signs in the marketplace, Fire totally HAD to be an element.\r\n\r\n“Each Class has an associated element with it. For the most part, any element can go with any class, but most classes benefit from having particular elements. For example, you could have [Courier] be an Earth class, but he’d most likely benefit from having a Wind class instead.”\r\n\r\nElements leaned into things. Particular jobs wanted particular elements. Easy enough.\r\n\r\n“Something like a [Blacksmith] could have fire, and have skills related to forges and heat. They could have an earth element, and deal with molds and the furnace. Metal would naturally be one of the most useful, probably getting some direct manipulation skills. Water is rarely seen with a blacksmith, but it could help with quenching. Wind is also pretty rare with a blacksmith, but they’d move faster, and have sharper weapons.” Elements! Fire. My eyes were blazing with rapt focus.\r\n\r\n“The Elements come in four pairs of two, and they’re paired up equal and opposite just like the stats they help. They are: Fire and Water; Earth and Wind; Light and Dark; Wood and Metal. Fire goes with Strength. That means if your class is Fire-aligned, for each level in the class you get, you’ll gain a point in Strength as well! Isn’t that neat!”\r\n\r\n“Fire is Strength. Water, opposing it, is Dexterity. Just like how getting points in Strength will eventually lower your Dexterity, Fire and Water oppose each other.”\r\n\r\n“Earth is Vitality, while Wind is Speed.”\r\n\r\n“Light is Mana Regeneration, while Darkness is Mana.”\r\n\r\n“Lastly, Wood is Magic Control, while Metal is Magic Power.”\r\n\r\nFyto spoke up at this moment. “Would you like a demonstration of skills and magic?”\r\n\r\nA mad chorus of yeses came from all of us except Kerberos. A chance to see magic performed for us? Yes please!\r\n\r\nFyto walked over to the patch of dirt, touched it with his foot, and intoned for our sake:\r\n\r\n“[Full Field Plow].”\r\n\r\nA ripple went over the field, turning the messy mud into neat rows of plowed earth, ready to be seeded.\r\n\r\nI’d seen magic before - everyone used it every day - but this seemed to be a step up from usual!\r\n\r\nArotro only gestured, and suddenly there were dozens of seeds that came from him, floating around the room. They playfully moved along the room, settling into neat rows on the plowed field.\r\n\r\nPrasinos lastly walked over, bent over – oh god that beautiful purple tunic better not touch dirt that would be a Major Sin – and spoke:\r\n\r\n“Watch carefully. This is what a [Rapid Growth] skill can do.”\r\n\r\nThe field exploded with growth. Squash, squash everywhere. I was amazed at the display of magic – real magic, not the small-time stuff the merchants did every day, and more amazed at how quickly the three of them had turned a patch of dirt into viable, tasty crops. And it was all done inside!\r\n\r\n“An amazing example of the Earth, Spore, and Verdant elements. There are a few more elements I didn’t mention, because they’re more advanced. Each pairing of primary elements creates a new, secondary element.”\r\n\r\nThat was – I did some quick thinking – a lot more elements.\r\n\r\n“Let’s talk about classes quickly before I let you run around and play.”\r\n\r\n“When the system unlocks, and as you advance, you’ll always have a class. It could be [Baker]. It could be [Soldier]. It could be [House Wife]. It could be bad, like [Thief]. You’ll usually have several options to choose from. You level up by doing things related to your class – in your case, simply being a child will level you up. Doing things outside of your class will also get you experience, but not as much as things inside of your class. Killing mean monsters will always get you lots of experience!”\r\n\r\n\"When your system unlocks, you’ll get your starter class automatically – it’ll probably be [Child of Remus] or [Child of Pallos], the first being much more common. You’ll gain a few levels, depending on what you’ve been doing since you were born, and when you finally get level 8, you’ll be able to get a new class! Exciting!”\r\n\r\n“We’re not sure on everything that decides a new class, but it seems to be based somewhat on your skills, what you’ve picked with them, and how high you’ve leveled them up. You will always have a choice when it comes to your non-starter classes. Listen to what your parents have to say, they should be able to get you a nice class to start with!”\r\n\r\n“Lastly, I’m sure you’re wondering why there are so many objects and things around the room. This is because of skills. Each class can have eight skills, and then you can have eight general skills on top of that. What skills you get, what skills you level, and how high you level them help determine what classes you’re offered. All of the things around the room are designed to get you started on various skills – if you start to make a pot out of clay, you’ll unlock the [Pottery] skill, and possibly even the [Ceramicist] class. If you swing a sword, you might get a fighting skill, and maybe even unlock the [Soldier Trainee] class if you’re very lucky! Lastly, trying many different things like this is almost guaranteed to get you the [Apprentice] class when you get to level 8, which will be useful for getting an apprenticeship.”\r\n\r\nSacerdus was saying something. I was too busy looking around. What stations did I want to try? The eight stations near the start made a lot more sense now – there was one for each element. Did that allow me to get some affinity for that element, unlocking the class? A pile of blocks, a block of clay, some dirty strips in a pile – lots of things for me to explore and try! It was clear now that I was supposed to try different things at different places, and pick up skills that way for my eventual leveling up! I chuckled as I rubbed my hands together, eager to start.\r\n\r\n“Now, girls, if you’ll leave, the boys can get started on the skills portion of today.” Kerberos leapt up with a happy cry, and immediately ran over to the swords. I just sat there stunned, trying to process what I had just heard.\r\n\r\nWhat. Completely stunned, visions of playing with hammers and blocks falling out of my mind, I didn’t resist at all as mom came over to pick me up. Perhaps sensing my inner turmoil, she picked me up and carried me out as thick, hot tears came spilling out of my eyes into her shoulder.\r\n\r\n“It’s not fair,” I choked out between sobs. “I wanted to play with all the things… and get skills.”\r\n\r\n“Shhh shhhh” Mom rocked me as she carried me back. “It’s ok. Hey, listen, let’s get you some food, and I’ll teach you some things that might turn into skills once we get back! Ok?”\r\n\r\nI furiously shook my head into her shoulder, sobbing my dreams out. Sensing the mood, mom continued to rock me and make soothing noises at me as we made it back across town to home. Coming inside, she laid me down on one of the recliners, and took my sandals off for me. I would normally complain about being treated like a baby, but I just didn’t care. What was the point of coming back with my memories intact, if I was just going to be stymied at every turn? What was the point of having magic, if it seemed like I wouldn’t be allowed to learn it? Mom picked me up and brought me to the bedroom, where she proceeded to tuck me in. Upset, exhausted, every bit of strength wrung out of me, I went to sleep.\r\n\r\nSystem Day sucked.\r\n'),
